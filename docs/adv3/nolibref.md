# TADS 3 Library Reference Manual - Not Installed

If you're seeing this page, it probably means that you installed the
version of the TADS 3 Author's Kit that *doesn't* include the Library
Reference Manual. This page is currently attempting to redirect you to
the on-line edition of the documentation on the
[tads.org](http://www.tads.org) Web site. If your browser doesn't
automatically display the on-line documentation after a few moments, you
might try navigating manually to this page:
