# Creating a TADS Game

\
\

\
\

## Step 1: Start TADS Workbench

Go to your Windows \"Start\" menu, and open the \"TADS Toolkit\" menu.
Click on \"TADS Workbench.\" TADS Workbench will launch, and will
display a dialog asking you whether you\'d like to create a new game or
open an existing game.\
\

## Step 2: Click on the \"New\" Button

You want to create a new game, so click on the \"New\" button. This will
open the TADS New Game Wizard, which will ask you for the names you\'d
like to use for your new game\'s files.\
\

## Step 3: Follow the Wizard Instructions

The New Game Wizard will ask you for the name you\'d like to use for
your \"source file.\" The source file is simply a text file where you
write your TADS programming language instructions that define the rooms
and objects in your game.

Do **not** put your source file in the same folder as the TADS program
files; instead, put your source file in a folder that you use for your
own personal files. In the future, you might want to upgrade to a new
version of TADS. When you do, the easiest way to upgrade is to delete
the old TADS program files and install the new versions. If you store
your game files in the TADS program folder, you might accidentally
delete your game files when you replace your TADS program files. To be
sure this doesn\'t happen, please put your source file in your own
personal folder.

If you\'re new to TADS, you should select the \"Introductory\" source
file type for your new source file. This simply puts extra examples in
your new source file, to help you get started more quickly.

After you\'ve answered all of the Wizard\'s questions, click the
\"Finish\" button to create your game. TADS Workbench will open your
game so that you can begin working on it.\
\

## Step 4: Try a Test Run

Once TADS Workbench has opened your file, you can try compiling it and
running it:

-   First, open the \"Build\" menu, and select \"Compile for
    Debugging.\" This will compile your game so that you can run it
    using the TADS Debugger, which is a built-in part of TADS Workbench.
    The compiler will display its results in the \"Debug Log\" window;
    once you see the message indicating that the build is finished, you
    can run your game.
-   Next, open the \"Debug\" menu and select \"Go\". (You can also
    simply press the F5 function key.)
-   Your game will start, and you can type commands into the game. When
    you\'re done, type the QUIT command to end the game. The game will
    remain loaded in TADS Workbench even after you quit, so you can run
    it again if you want to.

\
\

## Step 5: Editing your Source File

TADS Workbench features a built-in, full-featured text editor. The
window showing your game\'s main source file lets you make changes to
the code. To customize your game, simply edit the source file in this
window.

After you make changes, you must first save the file, then recompile
your game. The changes you make won\'t take effect until you compile, so
if you make changes and press \"Go\" without recompiling first, you\'ll
still see the old version of the game.

The built-in editor is a popular programmer\'s text editor called
Scintilla, which has all of the features that you\'d expect for a
programming environment: multi-level undo, syntax coloring, automatic
indenting, brace highlighting, and much more. Workbench also lets you
customize the keyboard layout, and provides a wide range of options to
tailor the editor to your preferences. Use the Options dialog to access
the many configuration options.

If you have a separate text editor program that you\'d prefer to use,
Workbench has some features designed to help. You can configure
Workbench to open a file in your external editor application - use the
\"External Editor\" page of the Options dialog to tell Workbench how to
open your editor program. After you do this, you can use the \"Open File
in External Editor\" command (on the Tools menu) to send a file from the
built-in Workbench editor directly to your separate editor application.
After you make your changes, you can switch back to Workbench to compile
and test the changes.\

## Step 6: Learning More about TADS

At this point, you\'re ready to start learning more about TADS. The
[Welcome](../authkit/welcome.htm) page has more information on where you
can find documentation, examples, and other resources for learning TADS.

Thanks for giving TADS a try!\
