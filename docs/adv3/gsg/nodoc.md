# Documentation Is Not Installed

If you\'re seeing this page, it probably means that you installed the
version of the TADS 3 Author\'s Kit that *doesn\'t* include
documentation. This page is currently attempting to redirect you to the
on-line edition of the documentation on the
[tads.org](http://www.tads.org) Web site. If your browser doesn\'t
automatically display the on-line documentation after a few moments, you
might try navigating manually to this page:\
