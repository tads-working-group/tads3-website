        <p>This is an unofficial informational website made by fans of the TADS 3
        authoring system in an attempt to spread the word about what we believe
        to be an underappreciated system, and provide a repository for more up
        to date information than is contained on the original <a href="https://tads.org">tads.org</a> website,
        which hasn't been updated since roughly 2013. For more information,
        however, definitely go check out that website too, as there is a lot of
        content there that we haven't covered here, just as there is content
        here not covered there.</p>
