# Workbench Project Starter Templates

TADS Workbench for Windows features a \"New Project\" command that
generates all of the files necessary to compile and run a skeleton game.
This saves the author the trouble of copying all of the boilerplate for
the .t3m and .t files making up the project.

If you\'re creating your own library that\'s designed to replace Adv3,
Workbench provides a way for you to plug in your own project starter
templates so that Workbench users can just as easily create new projects
based on your library. This section describes how to create a project
template.

## Template file format

When Workbench displays the New Project dialog, it offers a list of
project configurations for the user to choose from. Each entry in this
list comes from a project starter template file, which has the suffix
`.tdb-project-starter`. Workbench searches for all files with this
suffix in the Extensions folder, each folder in the Library Paths list,
and in the Workbench library folder. (Workbench searches all subfolders
of each of these folders as well.)

To create an entry for your library in the New Project dialog, then, you
just need to create a template file, and include it in your library
folder.

The template file contains text in a special format, with instructions
for Workbench on how to create the project. The file uses a simple
name/value pair format, with one item per line. An item looks like this:

::: code
    name: value
:::

The [name]{.code} must be at the very start of the line, with no leading
spaces. If a line starts with one or more spaces, it\'s read as a
continuation of the previous line. This allows you to break up long
values over several lines if needed for readability:

::: code
    name: This is a value that goes on for
      quite a while, requiring several lines
      to make it all fit neatly.
:::

When Workbench reads the file, it joins these lines together as though
the value had appeared all on the same line. Workbench replaces each
line break, along with all of the leading spaces on the following line,
with a single space.

Here\'s a list of the [name]{.code} elements and what they mean:

-   [name]{.code}: The title of the project configuration. This is
    displayed in the New Project dialog in the list of available project
    types. You should use something short and descriptive; it doesn\'t
    have to be an exhaustive description, because the [desc]{.code}
    value is also displayed in the same list. The standard project
    starters included with Workbench use these names:
    -   Adv3 - Introductory
    -   Adv3 - Advanced
    -   Adv3 - Introductory - Web UI
    -   Adv3 - Advanced - Web UI
    -   Plain T3

-   [desc]{.code}: A detailed description of the project. This is
    displayed in the New Project dialog, under the [name]{.code}. This
    should be a couple of sentences describing your library and the type
    of project this template would create.

-   [source]{.code}: The name of a source (.t) file that you provide as
    part of your library folder, that\'s meant to be **copied** into the
    user\'s new project folder. The value for this item is the name of
    the file that you provide, optionally followed by a space and the
    name of the file as it should appear in the user\'s copy. If you
    include only one name, the same name is used for the user\'s copy.
    If you provide two names, the second name can use a dollar sign (\$)
    as a substitution parameter: this is replaced with the project name
    that the New Project dialog asks the user to choose. For example,
    suppose that the user enters \"test one\" as the project name. If
    you enter this [source]{.code} item:

    ` source: start.t $.t `

    then the file [start.t]{.code} that you provide in your library
    folder will be copied into the new project folder with the name
    [test one.t]{.code}.

    Note that the [\$]{.code} can be used anywhere in the target file
    name; it doesn\'t have to be the entire name. For example, if you
    write [\$-actors.t]{.code} in the example above, the user\'s copy of
    the file would be [test one-actors.t]{.code}.

    You can use the [source]{.code} item repeatedly, if you wish, to
    copy multiple source files to the new project folder. Simply give
    each file a separate [source]{.code} line.

    You can place the source files to be copied into a subfolder of your
    library folder. If you do, simply use a relative Windows-style path
    in the [source]{.code} line:

    ` source: samples\start.t $.t `

    Workbench adds the [source]{.code} items to the new project\'s .t3m
    file in the same order in which they appear in the template file.

-   [lib]{.code}: The name of a source (.t) or library (.tl) file to
    include in the project\'s build list, but **without** copying it to
    the user\'s project folder. This is for files that will be included
    in the project directly from your library. As with [source]{.code},
    you can include as many [lib]{.code} items as you like.
    Workbench adds the files named in [lib]{.code} items to the new
    project\'s .t3m in the same order in which they appear in the
    template file.

-   [sysfile]{.code}: The name of a **system** source (.t) or library
    (.tl) file to include in the project\'s build list. This works just
    like [lib]{.code}, except that these files are taken from the
    Workbench standard library folder rather than from your library
    folder. Use this for files like [tok.t]{.code} or [tadsnet.t]{.code}
    that come with the standard Workbench distribution.

-   [define]{.code}: A preprocessor symbol to define. The value is a
    symbol, optionally followed by an equals sign (=) and the text to
    define for the symbol:

    ` define: LANGUAGE=en_us `

    Workbench will generate the appropriate compiler option to define
    the symbol in the macro preprocessor when the user builds the
    project. You can use as many [define]{.code} options as you need;
    simply use a separate [define]{.code} item for each symbol you wish
    to define.

-   [sequence]{.code}: A number giving the sorting order for this item.
    This is intended for use by the standard templates included with
    Workbench; replacement libraries should generally omit this. When
    displaying the list of available project types, Workbench puts items
    with [sequence]{.code} items at the top of the list, in order of
    their [sequence]{.code} values, followed by the remaining items
    sorted in alphabetic order of their [name]{.code} strings. The
    intention is that standard system items are displayed first,
    followed by third-party libraries.

## Example

Here\'s the template included with the standard Workbench installation
for the Introductory Adv3 Web UI project type.

::: code
    name: Adv3 - Introductory - Web UI
    sequence: 3
    desc: Create a game based on the Adv3 library for Web browser play.
      Your new project will be set up for deployment on Web servers, so
      that users can play in a browser without installing any TADS
      software.  This project starter includes a working game scenario 
      as an example to help you get started.
    source: samples\startI3.t $.t
    lib: adv3web.tl
    sysfile: webui.tl
    sysfile: tadsnet.t
    define: TADS_INCLUDE_NET
    define: LANGUAGE=en_us
    define: MESSAGESTYLE=neu
:::

## Installation

To distribute your library, simply create a ZIP file with all of your
.t, .tl, and .tdb-project-starter files. Instruct users to install your
library by following these steps:

-   Run Workbench, and verify that the Extensions folder is set up. This
    setting can be found by selecting the Tools - Options menu command
    and going to the System - Extensions pane. The Workbench installer
    normally sets this to \"My Documents\\TADS 3\\Extensions\", but
    users can change it if they prefer to keep extensions somewhere
    else. If there\'s no setting, the user should set it now.
-   Create a folder especially for your library in the Extensions
    folder.
-   Unzip your library files into the new folder.

There\'s no extra step to install your project template. Simply include
the .tdb-project-starter file in the folder containing your library\'s
.t and .tl files. Workbench automatically searches for
.tdb-project-starter files in the Extensions folder tree (including
sub-folders) and all of the folders in Library Paths list.
