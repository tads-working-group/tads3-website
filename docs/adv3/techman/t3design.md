# Tips on Designing your Game

This chapter is a somewhat personal take on the practical aspects of
writing IF with TADS 3. I offer some advice on the design and
development processes that I find to work for me, and some ideas on what
goes into a good work of IF.

Lest the title create any confusion, let me clear one thing up: this
isn\'t a *technical* tutorial in how to set up a game project or write
game code. I\'m going to assume here that you already know your way
around the TADS language and tools. This chapter is more about the
non-technical aspects of planning a game - how you develop an idea into
a plan, and how you implement the plan as a program.

This chapter is in two parts. The first part is about the practical
\"process\" aspects of creating IF. The second is about the aesthetics
of IF: namely what makes an enjoyable adventure game.
