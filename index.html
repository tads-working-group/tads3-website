        <h1>Empowering Ambitious Authors</h1>
        <p>TADS 3 is a <em>powerful and flexible interactive fiction
            authoring system</em> designed and built for <em>ambitious
            authors</em>. It brings to the table a <em>dynamic</em> yet <em>fun
            to use</em> object-oriented programming language that's
            purpose-built for writing primarily <em>parser-based</em>
            interactive fiction, and two standard libraries that push the
            boundaries of what the medium is capable of in terms of
            <em>simulation</em>, <em>customization</em>, and
            <em>multimedia</em>.<br/><br/></p>

                        <h3>Powerful</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Want to write a story with sophisticated world
                    simulation, dynamic runtime capabilities, advanced
                    programming constructs, wild new game mechanics, and more?
                    TADS can accomplish feats that are currently
                    impossible for other interactive fiction authoring
                    systems. Authors switching to TADS will see their
                    playground for creativity and innovation open up immensely!</p>

                        <h3>Simulation-Oriented</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Interested in simulation? Both of TADS 3's standard
                    libraries, adv3 and adv3lite, come with rich and
                    well-implemented world models
                    with all of the features you could possibly need for even
                    the most complex and simulation-heavy parser game. And, if you don't need these
                    features, they cleanly fade into the background.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Want to use new senses, or navigate in non-Euclidean
                        directions? Although TADS 3's standard libraries come with
                        highly complex world models already, those assumptions are
                        just your starting point! TADS 3 is designed to make your
                        own code, the standard library code, and even the language
                        itself, flexible and extensible in a way that makes games
                        fun to write and easy to iterate on.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Already comfortable with programming? TADS 3 is designed
                    with advanced interactive fiction authors in mind, offering
                    the clarity, conciseness, and specificity of a fully-fledged
                    programming language with all the capabilities you would
                    expect and much more. TADS is confident in its authors'
                    ability to use complex, powerful, and advanced feature sets,
                    which enables it to do a lot more without worrying about
                    whether its users can keep up.</p>

            <h2>Ready to <em>learn more</em>?</h2>

            <p>TADS 3 is comprised of several core components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A <em><a
                href="http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/sysman/langsec.htm">special-purpose
                object-oriented programming language</a></em> designed with
                concise yet readable syntax and a focus on
                <em>extensibility</em>, <em>dynamic typing</em>, and <em>ease of
                defining objects and the relations between them</em>. It has
                features like advanced multiple inheritance, multimethods,
                operator overloading, a garbage collector, anonymous functions,
                Smalltalk-style catch-all methods, runtime reflection, and more.
                The TADS 3 language makes growing and modifying your game
                &mdash; and the standard library! &mdash; faster, more fun, and
                easier than a general purpose language by being a language custom-designed for the use case of
                authoring semantic simulations like interactive fiction games.</li>

                <li>Two powerful <em>text-adventure-specific <a href="https://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/index.htm">standard</a> <a href="https://faroutscience.com/adv3lite_docs/">libraries</a></em> containing <em>advanced world models</em> that have things
                    like <em>room parts</em>, <em>sense-passing</em>, a complex understanding of
                <em>attachable and detachable sub components and object
                    relationships</em>, and <em>hundreds of different powerful properties</em> to customize the precise
                behavior of each object, an advanced and extremely customizable
                parser that can understand arbitrary custom sentences, and
                perform user-customizable spell check &mdash; and more.</li>

                <li>A performant <em>compiler</em> to compile these programs.</li>

                <li>An advanced <em>virtual machine</em> to run TADS programs and produce output.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In addition, there are also different kinds of <em>interpreters</em> that
            use the virtual machine to run your TADS games and then interpret
            the output produced by the games into the multimedia output and
            graphical user interface players see.</p>

            <p>To learn more about, and download, these components, see <a href="#install">below.</a></p>

            <p>TADS 3 also has an <i>extensive</i> set of learning resources, including
                roughly <em>eight book-length references and guides</em>,
                 all of which are detailed, orderly, clear, and thorough.
            If you've struggled with the documentation of other interactive
            fiction authoring systems in the past, or are concerned that using
            such a niche piece of software will make answers hard to find, fear
            not! Michael J. Roberts and Eric Eve have ensured that no TADS
            programmer will ever stay confused for long. For more information on
            which manuals to read and where to find a full list of TADS
            documentation for each of the respective standard libraries, please

                    <h3>Advanced <em>multimedia capabilities</em></h3>
                    <p>Did you know that using a subset of HTML, TADS 3 games can have embedded images,
                    colorful text with script and monospaced fonts (as well as
                    the usual bold, italic, underline, and strighthrough),
                    centered text, and simultaneous music and sound effects (with
                    channels for foreground, looping background, and sporadic
                    background sounds)? They can! They can also have clickable
                    hyperlinks, as well as clickable text that functions as
                    buttons for in-game actions. TADS 3 games can embed
                    multimedia files as well, allowing you to ship one single
                    file with everything your game needs to run.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="card">
                    <h3>Advanced <em>user interface capabilities</em></h3>
                    <p>In addition to clickable hyperlinks and embedded buttons,
                    TADS 3 games can also use multiple different UI
                    panes that can animate, as well as add stylized custom
                    borders to the game play window.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="card">
                    <h3><em>Extensible</em> standard library</h3>
                    <p>Any object or class, including intrinsic ones built into
                    the language and standard library ones, can be modified
                    <i>or replaced</i> in TADS 3 code. This gives authors the
                    ability to confidently tinker with things, even including
                    basic features like TADS 3's autocorrect and command
                    clarification system, or what commands like undo, redo,
                    save, and restore do! Even the main game loop and the
                    <b>parser itself</b> are customizable components of the TADS
                    standard library. In fact, although TADS games typically use
                    a traditional world model of objects, rooms, and directional
                    connections, this could be replaced with any
                    world model while still taking advantage of the fact that
                    TADS 3 offers a language designed specifically to make
                    representing complex objects and relationships and mechanics
                    between them easy and clear.</p>

                    <h3><em>Dynamic</em> during play as well as during development</h3>
                    <p>TADS 3 has the powerful ability to create new objects or
                    clone existing ones dynamically during play, thanks to its
                    built in garbage collector. Moreover, TADS games can perform
                    full procedural generation of everything from maps to
                    properties, as well as "bake" games, allowing you to run
                    instructions in your game before the final game image is
                    created! TADS 3 games can also read and write files within
                    the game file's current directory using a wide
                    array of file types including custom binary formats, as well
                    as perform network requests and even act as a server! TADS 3
                    can even procedurally generate and run code during play,
                    even code entered by the player, and use runtime reflection
                    capabilities.</p>

                    <p>With Web UI, TADS 3 games can include online multiplayer,
                    as well as arbitary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (as opposed to
                    the limited HTML subset in HTML TADS) in their
                    games, allowing for a much wider variety of game
                    experiences, and TADS has a special library that allows the TADS 3
                    game to talk directly to the JavaScript, allowing you to add
                    custom user interface elements such as directional arrow
                    buttons or action buttons or a tile map constructed from
                    TADS's own internal map that pathfinds a character to any
                    location they click on.</p>

            <h2 id="interpreter">Getting an <em>interpreter</em></h2>

            <p>There are three types of TADS interpreters:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>HTML TADS interpeters</em>, which support the fully panoply of TADS' built-in
                    multimedia, interface, and virtual machine runtime features;</li>
                <li><em>text-only TADS interpreters</em>, which just ignore all the
                    multimedia commands and display only text, and can sometimes not support the full runtime,</li>
                <li>and the <em>Web UI TADS interpreter</em>, which can be enabled in your game image so that when run, the game
                    will function as a server and serve up a full HTML TADS interpeter
                    into the web browser, with a lot of <a href="https://tads.org/t3doc/doc/sysman/webui.htm">extra</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/Otto73/TADS3">functionality</a>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>HTML TADS</h3>
            <p>If you want to play or develop regular TADS 3 games the simplest
            and most supported way, we recommend going with an HTML TADS
            interpreter. Currently, the best one is <em><a
            href="https://realnc.github.io/qtads/">QTADS</a></em>, both because
            it is the most feature-complete and bug free, and because it is
            still being regularly updated and improved (at least as of May 17,
            2023). It has versions available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. If
            the links below don't suit your needs, more architectures and OS
            versions are listed on the qTADS downloads page.</p>

            <a class="download-button" href="https://github.com/realnc/qtads/releases/download/v3.4.0/QTads-3.4-Linux-x86_64-AppImage.tar.gz">

                Download
                QTADS
            </a>

            <p>There is also the confusingly-named "HTML TADS" for Windows,
            available on the <a href="https://www.tads.org/t3dl/pksetup.exe">official TADS website</a>,
            which was the reference implementation for TADS interpreters but
            which has not been updated since at best 2013.</p>

            <h3>Text-only and Web UI</h3>
            <p>If you want to run the Web UI or just want to use a text-only
            interpreter, we recommend <em><a href="https://github.com/realnc/frobtads/releases">FrobTADS</a></em>,
            as it has the most complete implementation of the virtual
            machine/runtime and can run headless, so it makes sense to use as a
            server, and since it also has a nice text-only interpreter built in. FrobTADS
            has also been recently updated, reaching version 2.0 in 2021.</p>

            <h3>Text-only</h3>
            <p>The popular multi-format interpreter <em><a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a></em> can
            also run TADS games, but it does so in text-only mode and is not
            capable of running a Web UI, so it is recommended not to use this
            unless you're just playing a few TADS games and don't care about the
            missing features.</p>

            <h2 id="compiler">Getting a <em>compiler</em></h2>
            <p>If you intend to develop TADS 3 games, you'll need a compiler to
            turn your source files into a game file that an interpreter can run.
            On Windows, you can use <em><a
            href="https://www.tads.org/tads3.htm#">the official Author's Kit for
            Windows</a></em>, although compatibility with modern 64-bit
            operating systems is in question. On macOS, Linux, or BSD, you can
            use <em><a href="https://github.com/realnc/frobtads/releases">FrobTADS</a></em>,
            which should run fine on modern machines.</p>

            <h2 id="editor">Setting up your <em>development environment</em></h2>

            <p>Although the TADS 3 Author's Kit for Windows comes with a full-fledged IDE called Workbench, that program is now very old and probably doesn't have all the features you're used to in a modern editor. As a result, across the board, we recommend one of two editors for
            writing TADS:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toerob.vscode-tads3tools">TADS 3 Tools for Visual Studio Code</a></em> offers
                a feature-rich and easy to use integrated development
                environment for TADS 3 authors, so if you have no specific
                editor preference or already use Visual Studio Code, it is
                highly recommended.</li>

                <li>There is also <em><a href="https://github.com/alexispurslane/tads3-mode">tads3-mode</a></em>
                for Emacs, which offers slightly better auto completion and most
                of the basic necessary capabilities to make a modern programmer
                feel at home, but which is admittedly not as advanced as TADS 3
                Tools. This is for relatively advanced authors who prefer not to
                use Visual Studio Code for whatever reason.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="learn">
            <h2>Which standard library should I choose, <em>adv3</em> or <em>adv3Lite</em>?</h2>

            <p>Yes, that's right, TADS 3 has <i>two</i> standard libraries! Here's the breakdown:</p>

            <div class="side-by-side">
                <div id="adv3">
                    <!-- extend this to be more fair! -->
                    <img class="marketing-icon" src="assets/beard-svgrepo-com.svg"/>
                    <h3>The big, complex, full-featured graybeard: <em>adv3</em></h3>
                    <p><em><a href="http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/index.htm">Adv3</a></em>
                        is the default standard library distributed with TADS 3.
                        It is quite old, having been created along with TADS in
                        2006 and last having been updated in 2013, but that
                        comes along with some benefits as well as some
                        downsides. The main benefit of using adv3 is that it is
                        <i>incredibly</i> complete. It comes packed with every
                        concievable object type, class, or feature you could
                        possibly need, and an incredibly complex world model
                        already wired up and integrated into the whole, so that
                        any game you create with it will automatically be
                        running with a world model more complex than almost any
                        parser interactive fiction game.</p>

                    <p> The downside, however, is that adv3 relies on an
                        incredibly deep and complex multiple inheritence class
                        hierarchy and a huge number of highly specific classes,
                        which it relies heavily on as mix-ins to customize the
                        behavior of objects. Moreover, it is not particularly
                        modular, so every game you write with it will have to
                        bring in that whole gigantic world model. Furthermore,
                        it is not as explicitly designed for extensibility or
                        customizability as adv3Lite is. Thus, if you want a very
                        complex and simulation-heavy parser game, and what you
                        want to do fits with the existing carefully crafted
                        complex world model of adv3, then it might be for you.
                        If not, you might want to look at adv3Lite.</p>

                    <p>Another downside is that adv3 lacks many of the features popular
                        in modern interactive fiction authoring systems, such as
                        scenes, regions, rules, relations, and more.</p>

                    <h3>The lightweight, modular, and modern newcomer: <em>adv3Lite</em></h3>
                    <p><em><a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~manc0049/TADSGuide/adv3Lite.htm">Adv3Lite</a></em>
                        is a newer standard library created by Eric Eve, and
                        has been updated as recently as 2023. The main benefit of
                        adv3Lite is that the class hierarchy is much simpler, since most
                        customization for objects has been relocated to properties on a
                        single class representing that kind of thing, instead of
                        in a main base class and several mix-in classes.
                        Additionally, the library has been made more modular and
                        extensible compared to adv3, so if you
                        want to write very obscure or strange game mechanics or
                        world models that don't slot neatly into adv3's existing
                        world model, adv3lite is for you. Some features have
                        been streamlined out in comparison to adv3, but the some
                        of the common ones, such as room parts, postures, and
                        library classes as a shorthand for properties, can be
                        added back via extensions.</p>

                    <p>However, as the adv3Lite website says, you get several
                        crucial new features with adv3Lite that have become
                        popular in the modern interactive fiction authoring
                        space and which adv3 does not offer:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Doers</em> which work like <em>instead rules</em> in Inform 7,
                            allowing you to specify command queries that apply under certain
                            conditions and override the default action;</li>

                        <li><em>the vocab property</em>, which allows you to define
                            several vocabulary-related properties of an object all at once
                            in a concinse and convenient manner more akin to how it works in
                            Inform;</li>

                        <li>a <em>world-model query system</em> for making queries about
                            the general state of the world;</li>

                        <li>the introduction of <em>message parameter substitutions</em>
                            to automatically choose words based on person, number, and
                            tense, including working for over <em>200 irregular verbs</em> and plurals;</li>

                        <li>built in <em>pathfinding</em> for players and AIs;</li>

                        <li>built in debugging commands;</li>

                        <li><em>regions</em> and region-located backdrops, scenery, events,
                            actions, senses, and so on;</li>

                        <li>scenes;</li>

                        <li>automatic grouping of objects;</li>

                        <li>built in help for new players;</li>

                        <li>and a significantly enhanced conversation and NPC AI
                            system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>There is also an <em><a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXtads3XlibraryXcontributions">extensive
            list</a></em> of other community-contributed extensions and
            libraries on the IF Archive, should you need features not available
            even in the existing standard libraries. All of these are compatible
            with adv3 and most can probably be trivially made compatible with
            adv3Lite, in our experience. Just a few of the delightful things you'll
            find there include qtalk, a suprisingly feature-complete plugin for
            Fallout-style menu based conversation, Achievement, a library for
            creating and persistantly storing Steam-style achievements,
            and ConSpace, an extension that enhances the modelling of spatial
            relations and allows several rooms to act as one large subdivided
            location!</p>

                            <p>TADS 1.0 was written and designed by <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Michael_J._Roberts">Michael J. Roberts</a> and
                                released in September of 1990 as shareware under the imprint of "High Energy
                                Software", a company created by Roberts and his friend Steve McAdams, at a time
                                when the only other option for writing interactive fiction was <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/AGT">AGT</a>. It was fairly popular at the time, spawning a trilogy of shareware Zork homage/parodies that were "the most concerted and sustained effort at building a real business out of [the shareware IF scene]" at
                                the time.<sup><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/02/tads/">1</a></sup></p>

                            <p>By the time of TADS 2.2.1, released in October of 1996, due to a
                                lack of money in the shareware business, TADS was released as
                                freeware: although not stricty free software, since forks and modifications for
                                the purpose of anything but porting were verboten, free
                                use, copying, and distribution were now allowed.</p>

                            <p>Also <a href="https://github.com/tajmone/tads-sources">open source</a> freeware,
                            TADS 3, first released on September 15, 2006, was
                            designed by <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Michael_J._Roberts">Michael J. Roberts</a> as
                                a brand new revitalization superceding TADS 2. Despite being
                                released in the early oughts, TADS 3 still pushes the boundaries of
                                interactive fiction authoring system capabilities and world models
                                in many ways, including with runtime object cloning and creation,
                                multi-channel audio capabilities, and sense-passing for any kind of
                                sense, even user-defined ones. The core appeal of TADS goes beyond
                                specific features, however.</p>

            <p>If you want to learn more about the history of TADS, I recommend checking out the Digital Antiquarian's article <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/02/tads/">here</a>.
            Unfortunately, that article only covers the early history, and what
            we know of the rest is spotty at best.</p>
