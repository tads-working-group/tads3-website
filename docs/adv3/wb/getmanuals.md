# How to Install the TADS Manuals

\
\

If you\'re reading this file, it probably means that you\'ve selected
\"TADS 3 Manual\" from the TADS Workbench Help menu, but the
documentation files aren\'t installed on your system. The documentation
files should have been installed along with TADS Workbench, but these
files have evidently been deleted or moved. Please re-install TADS.\
