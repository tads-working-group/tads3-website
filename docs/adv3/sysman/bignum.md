# BigNumber

The T3 VM\'s basic numeric type is the integer type. While this is
largely adequate for writing interactive fiction, it\'s sometimes useful
to have access to floating-point and high-precision integer arithmetic.
The BigNumber type provides this functionality.

BigNumber can represent values with enormous precision, storing up to
65,000 decimal digits in a value; and can represent a huge range of
values, with absolute values up to 10^32767^ and down to 10^-32767^.
These limits are so extreme that real-world calculations should
practically never bump up against them. Furthermore, the BigNumber type
can store values with whatever precision you actually need for each
particular value, up to the limits; a program can use this flexibility
to strike the balance it requires between numerical precision and
performance.

For reasons that are probably obvious, the more precision a BigNumber
value stores, the more memory it uses and the more time it takes to
perform calculations with the number. BigNumber lets you specify how
much precision to use, letting you balance precision against speed and
memory use.

Note that the BigNumber type is not the \"double\" or IEEE floating
point type that you might have encountered in other programming
languages. The BigNumber type is actually a custom type implemented
entirely in the T3 VM. This has several advantages over \"doubles\":

-   Doubles can have subtle, sometimes vexing variations from one
    computer to another. Many programmers treat doubles as fuzzy and
    capricious approximations, chalking up any unexpected variations to
    unfathomable hardware internals. BigNumber, in contrast, is
    portable, and behaves exactly the same way on every computer, down
    to the last digit.
-   BigNumber uses a decimal rather than binary encoding, which means
    that any value that can be written in decimal can be represented
    exactly as a BigNumber, without any rounding error. Most people are
    accustomed to writing their numbers in decimal, so this makes
    BigNumber a \"what you see is what you get\" type. Some values that
    can be represented exactly in decimal can\'t be represented exactly
    in a binary encoding. For example, 1/5 is an endlessly repeating bit
    pattern in binary, much as 1/3 is an endless sequence in decimal
    (0.333333\...), which means 1/5 can\'t be exactly represented with a
    binary double. This can be counterintuitive, because 1/5 is such a
    nice, round value - 0.2 - in decimal. Of course, numbers like 1/3
    can\'t be expressed exactly in a decimal encoding, so using decimal
    doesn\'t eliminate this issue; but we tend to be already accustomed
    to which fractions can and can\'t be represented exactly in decimal,
    so it\'s at least somewhat more intuitive when rounding is required.
    Furthermore, since numbers are usually entered and displayed in
    decimal, keeping them in decimal internally avoids compounding any
    rounding errors on input and output.
-   BigNumber allows for effectively unlimited precision. Doubles have a
    fixed precision - only about 16 decimal digits. The nearly unlimited
    precision of BigNumber enables calculations involving very large
    integers, for example, or precise calculations where very large and
    very small values are combined.

We don\'t mean to suggest that BigNumbers are superior to doubles in
every way. Doubles do have some advantages of their own, the big one
being speed. Doubles are implemented in hardware on many platforms,
which is nearly always much faster than a software implementation. Even
when doubles are implemented in software, they tend to be faster than a
type like BigNumber, because fixed-precision algorithms are inherently
simpler. You probably wouldn\'t want to use BigNumbers in an intensive
number-crunching scientific application. But that\'s not the kind of
program TADS is designed for, so we think the tradeoff - greater
flexibility, slower performance - is a reasonable one. Plus, it\'s
rather neat to be able to calculate *pi* to a thousand digits with a
couple of lines of code.

## Working with BigNumber values

You must [#include \<bignum.h\>]{.code} in your source files to use the
BigNumber class. This file defines the BigNumber class interface.

You can write a BigNumber value as a floating-point constant. This is a
numeric constant that contains a decimal point or an exponent, or both.
Syntactically, that means one of these formats:

::: syntax
    digit ... ( E | e )  [ + | - ]  digit ...
    [ digit ... ]  . ( digit ... )  [ ( E | e )  [ + | - ]  digit ...
    digit ... . [ ( E | e )  [ + | - ]  digit ... ] 
:::

For example:

::: code
    x = 3.14159265;
:::

This syntax actually creates a BigNumber object that represents the
given number. The compiler assigns the BigNumber\'s precision based on
the number of significant digits in the constant value: this is the
number of digits, ignoring leading zeros. For example, [0.00001]{.code}
has only one digit of precision, since the leading zeros are ignored,
whereas [0.00001000]{.code} has a precision of four digits, since
trailing zeros are significant. The one exception to the leading-zero
rule is that if the value is actually zero, *all* of the zeros in the
constant are significant: so [0.0000000]{.code} has a precision of 8
digits.

You can also use the [new]{.code} operator to create a BigNumber. Pass
the value for the number either as an integer or as a character string.
You can optionally specify the precision to use for the value; if you
don\'t specify a precision, the system infers a precision from the
value. If the source value is a string, the implied precision is the
number of significant digits, the same as for a constant BigNumber
value; if the source is an integer, the default precision is 32 digits.

::: code
    x = new BigNumber(100);
    x = new BigNumber(100, 10); // set precision to 10 digits
    y = new BigNumber('3.14159265');
    z = new BigNumber('1.06e-30');
    z = new BigNumber('1.06e-30', 8); // precision is 8 digits
:::

If you specify a string value, you can use a decimal point, and you can
also use an \'E\' to specify a base-ten exponent. So, the fourth value
above should be read as 1.06×10^-30^.

Using the [new]{.code} operator has the advantage that you can
explicitly specify the precision you want for the new value. If you do,
it overrides the default precision that would otherwise be inferred from
the source value.

You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
negation on BigNumber values using the standard operators. You can also
use integer values with BigNumber values in calculations, although the
BigNumber value must always be the first operand in an expression
involving both a BigNumber and an integer.

::: code
    x = y + z;
    x = (y + z) * (y - z) / 2;
:::

Similarly, you can compare BigNumber values using the normal comparison
operators:

::: code
    if (x > y)
      // ... 
:::

You can convert a BigNumber to a string using the [toString()]{.code}
function in the tads-gen intrinsic function set. [toString()]{.code}
uses a default formatting, though, so if you want control over the
format, you should use the [formatString()]{.code} method of the
BigNumber object itself.

You can convert a BigNumber to a regular integer value using the
[toInteger()]{.code} function from the tads-gen function set. Note that
[toInteger()]{.code} throws an error if passed a [BigNumber]{.code}
value that\'s too large to represent as a 32-bit integer. The integer
type can only store values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.
[toInteger()]{.code} rounds numbers with fractional parts to the nearest
integer.

You can\'t use operators other than those listed above with BigNumber
values. You can\'t use a BigNumber as an operand for any of the bitwise
operators ([&]{.code}, [\|]{.code}, [\~]{.code}). You also can\'t use a
BigNumber with the integer modulo operator ([%]{.code}), but you can
obtain similar functionality from the [divideBy()]{.code} method.

You can\'t use BigNumber values in function and method calls that
require integer arguments. You must explicitly convert a BigNumber value
to an integer with the [toInteger()]{.code} function if you want to pass
it to a method or function that takes an integer value; the compiler
does not perform these conversions for you automatically.

Because BigNumber values are, for most purposes, simply object
references, you can use them where you can use other objects; you can,
for example, store a BigNumber in a list, or assign it to an object
property.

## Rounding

BigNumber works with numbers of the precision you tell it to. This means
that some calculations won\'t return all of the digits in the full
mathematical result, since BigNumber has to round the result to fit into
the precision you specify.

For example, mathematically, 1.7\*0.25 = 0.425. But the expression
[1.7\*0.25]{.code} will yield the BigNumber value [0.42]{.code}. The
BigNumber calculation loses digits, compared to the mathematically exact
result.

Why is this? It\'s because BigNumber calculations generally yield
results using the same precision as the most precise operand. In the
case of [1.7\*0.25]{.code}, we have two operands, [1.7]{.code} and
[0.25]{.code}, each with two digits of precision. (Remember that leading
zeros don\'t count as significant digits, so [0.25]{.code} only has two
digits of precision.) So the precision of the result will also be two
digits.

Internally, BigNumber performs the calculation with a couple of extra
\"guard digits\", to ensure more accurate results. When returning the
final value of the calculation, though, the result must be rounded to
the result precision. So BigNumber actually calculates the value 0.4250
internally, then rounds it to two digits before returning the final
result.

BigNumber uses a standard rounding method known as \"round to nearest,
ties to even\". This method does the obvious thing for most values, by
rounding them up or down to the nearest digit. For example, rounding 1.3
to integer yields 1, and rounding 1.7 yields 2. The only tricky part is
that when rounding a value that\'s exactly halfway between two digits,
we round to the nearest *even* digit. So rounding 1.5 to integer rounds
up to 2, since that\'s the nearest even digit, but rounding 2.5 to
integer rounds down to 2, since that\'s once again the nearest even
digit.

For our example of rounding 0.4250 to two digits, we\'re at one of these
halfway points, so we invoke the \"even digit\" rule and round to 0.42
(not 0.43, since 3 is odd).

If we instead calculate [1.9\*0.25]{.code}, the mathematical result is
0.4750, which again rounds to the nearest even digit, giving us 0.48.

One more example: [1.9\*0.33]{.code} yields 0.6270 mathematically. In
this case, we\'re not at a halfway point, so this yields the obvious
rounded value of 0.63.

## Calling methods on BigNumber values

The BigNumber class provides a number of methods for manipulating
values. Note that all of the methods that perform calculations return
new BigNumber values. A BigNumber object\'s value is immutable once the
object is created, so all calculations performed on these objects return
new objects representing the result values.

These functions are all methods called on a BigNumber object. For
example, to calculate the absolute value of a BigNumber value
[x]{.code}, we would code this:

::: code
    y = x.getAbs();
:::

Some of the methods take an argument giving a value to be combined with
the target number. For example, to get the remainder of dividing 10 by
3, we\'d write this:

::: code
    x = new BigNumber('10.0000');
    y = new BigNumber('3.00000');
    rem = x.divideBy(y)[2];  // second list item is remainder
:::

## BigNumber methods

[arccosine()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the arccosine (the number whose cosine is this value), as a
value in radians, of the number. This function is mathematically
meaningful only for input values from -1 to +1; this function throws a
run-time exception if the input value is outside of this range.
:::

[arcsine()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the arcsine (the number whose sine is this value), as a value in
radians, of the number. This function is mathematically meaningful only
for input values from -1 to +1; this function throws a run-time
exception if the input value is outside of this range.
:::

[arctangent()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the arctangent (the number whose tangent is this value), as a
value in radians, of the number.
:::

[copySignFrom(*x*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a number containing the same absolute value as this number, but
with the sign of x replacing the original value\'s sign.
:::

[cosh()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the hyperbolic cosine of the number and returns the result.
:::

[cosine()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the trigonometric cosine of the number (interpreted as a radian
value) and returns the result. Refer to the description of sine() for
notes on how the input precision affects the calculation.
:::

[degreesToRadians()]{.code}

::: fdef
Converts the value from radians to degrees and returns the number of
degrees. This simply multiplies the value by (*pi*/180).
:::

[divideBy(*x*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the integer quotient of dividing this number by x, and returns
a list with two elements. The first element is a BigNumber value giving
the integer quotient, and the second element is a BigNumber value giving
the remainder of the division, which is a number *remainder* satisfying
the relationship *dividend* [=]{.code} *quotient*[\*]{.code}*divisor*
[+]{.code} *remainder*.

Note that the quotient returned from [divideBy()]{.code} is not
necessarily equal to the whole part of the result of the division
([/]{.code}) operator applied to the same values. If the precision of
the result (which is, as with all calculations, equal to the larger of
the precisions of the operands) is insufficient to represent exactly the
integer quotient result, the quotient returned from this function will
be rounded differently from the quotient returned by the division
operator. The division operator always rounds its result to the nearest
integer; in contrast, [divideBy]{.code} does **not** round the quotient,
but instead truncates any trailing digits beyond the result\'s
precision. The reason for this difference is that the truncation ensures
that the relationship (dividend = quotient\*divisor + remainder) always
holds for [divideBy]{.code} results, which would not always be the case
if the quotient were rounded.

Also, the remainder will not necessarily be less than the divisor. If
the quotient can\'t be represented exactly (this occurs if the precision
of the quotient is smaller than its scale), the remainder will be the
correct value so that the relationship (dividend = quotient\*divisor +
remainder) holds, rather than the unique remainder that\'s smaller than
the divisor. In all cases where the result precision is sufficient to
represent the exact integer quotient, the remainder will satisfy this
relationship **and** will be the unique remainder with absolute values
less than the divisor.
:::

[equalRound(*num*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Determine if this value is equal to num after rounding. This is
equivalent to the [==]{.code} operator if the numbers have the same
precision, but if one number is more precise than the other, this rounds
the more precise of the two values to the precision of the less precise
value, then compares the values. The [==]{.code} operator makes an exact
comparison, effectively extending the precision of the less precise
value by adding imaginary zeros to the end of the number.
:::

[expE()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the result of raising *e*, the base of the natural logarithm, to
the power of this number.
:::

[]{#formatString}

[formatString(*maxDigits*?, *flags*?, *wholePlaces*?, *fracDigits*?,
*expDigits*?, *leadFiller*?)]{.code}

::: fdef
Formats the number, returning a string with the result. All of the
arguments are optional.

*maxDigits* specifies the maximum number of digits to display in the
formatted number; this is an upper bound only, and doesn\'t force a
minimum number of digits. If necessary, the function uses scientific
notation to make the number fit in the requested number of digits. The
default is the actual precision of the number (that is, the number of
decimal digits actually stored with the number).

*wholePlaces* specifies the minimum number of places to show before the
decimal point; if the number doesn\'t fill all of the requested places,
the function inserts leading spaces (before the sign character, if any).

*fracDigits* specifies the number of digits to display after the decimal
point. This specifies the maximum to display, and also the minimum; if
the number doesn\'t have enough digits to display, the method adds
trailing zeros, and if there are more digits than *fracDigits* allows,
the method rounds the value for display.

*expDigits* is the number of digits to display in the exponent; leading
zeros are inserted if necessary to fill the requested number of places.

Each of *maxDigits*, *wholePlaces*, *fracDigits*, and *expDigits* can be
specified as [nil]{.code} or -1, which tells the method to use the
default value, which is simply the number of digits actually needed for
the respective part.

*leadFiller*, if specified, gives a string that is used instead of
spaces to fill the beginning of the string, if required to satisfy the
*wholePlaces* argument. This argument is ignored if its value is
[nil]{.code}. If a string value is provided for this argument, the
characters of the string are inserted, one at a time, to fill out the
*wholePlaces* requirement; if the end of the string is reached before
the full set of padding characters is inserted, the function starts over
again at the beginning of the string. For example, to insert alternating
asterisks and pound signs, you would specify [\'\*#\']{.code} for this
argument.

*flags* is a combination of the following bit-flag values (combined with
the bit-wise OR operator, [\|]{.code}). The default *flags* value is 0,
meaning that none of these options are selected. [nil]{.code} is
equivalent to 0 for the *flags* argument.

-   [BignumSign]{.code} - always show a sign character. Normally, if the
    number is positive, the function omits the sign character. If this
    flag is specified, a [+]{.code} sign is shown for a positive number.
-   [BignumPosSpace]{.code} - if the number is positive and this flag is
    set, the function inserts a leading space. (If [BignumSign]{.code}
    is specified, this flag is ignored.) This function can be used to
    ensure that positive and negative numbers fill the same number of
    character positions, even when you don\'t want to use a [+]{.code}
    sign with positive numbers.
-   [BignumExp]{.code} - always show the number in exponential format
    (scientific notation, as in \"1.0e+20\"). If this is not included,
    the function shows the number without an exponent if it will fit in
    *maxDigits* digits.
-   [BignumExpSign]{.code} - always show a sign in the exponent. If this
    is included, a positive exponent will be shown with a [+]{.code}
    sign. This flag is ignored unless an exponent is displayed (so
    specifying this flag doesn\'t force an exponent to be displayed).
-   [BignumLeadingZero]{.code} - always show a zero before the decimal
    point. This is only important when the number\'s absolute value is
    between 0 and 1, and an exponent isn\'t displayed; without this
    flag, no digits will precede the decimal point for such values (so
    0.25 would be formatted as simply [\'.25\']{.code}).
-   [BignumPoint]{.code} - always show a decimal point. If the number
    has no fractional digits to display, and this flag is included, a
    trailing decimal point is displayed. Without this flag, no decimal
    point is displayed if no digits are displayed after the decimal
    point.
-   [BignumCommas]{.code} - show commas to set off thousands, millions,
    billions, and so on. This flag has no effect if the number is shown
    in scientific notation. Commas don\'t count against the *maxDigits*
    or *wholePlaces* limits. However, commas do count for leading
    filler, which ensures that a column of numbers formatted with filler
    and commas will line up properly.
-   [BignumEuroStyle]{.code} - use European-style formatting: use
    periods instead of commas to set off thousands, millions, etc., and
    use a comma instead of a period to indicate the decimal point.
-   [BignumCompact]{.code} - use the shorter of the regular format or
    the exponential format. If the decimal exponent is less than -4, or
    greater than or equal to the number of digits after the decimal
    point, exponential format is used; otherwise the regular format is
    used.
-   [BignumMaxSigDigits]{.code} - treat the *maxDigits* argument as the
    maximum number of significant digits to show, not total digits. This
    doesn\'t count leading zeros against the *maxDigits* limit.
-   [BignumKeepTrailingZeros]{.code} - keep trailing zeros as needed to
    fill out the *maxDigits* size. By default, trailing zeros after the
    decimal point are removed. This is ignored if there\'s no
    *maxDigits* value.
:::

[getAbs()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a number containing the absolute value of this number. (This
function could be easily coded from a comparison and negation, but the
method implementation is more efficient.)
:::

[getCeil()]{.code}

::: fdef
\"Ceiling\": returns a number containing the least integer greater than
this number. For example, the ceiling of 2.2 is 3. Note that for
negative numbers, the least integer above a number has a smaller
absolute value, so the ceiling of -1.6 is -1.
:::

[getE(*digits*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the value of *e* (the base of the natural logarithm,
approximately 2.781828183) to the given number of digits of precision.
This is a static method, so you can call this method directly on the
BigNumber class itself:

::: code
    x = BigNumber.getE(10);
:::

The BigNumber class internally caches the value of *e* to the highest
precision calculated so far during the program\'s execution, so this
routine only needs to compute the value when it is called with a higher
precision than that of the previously cached value.
:::

[getFloor()]{.code}

::: fdef
\"Floor\": returns a number containing the greatest integer less than
this number.
:::

[getFraction()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a number containing only the fractional part of this number (the
digits after the decimal point).
:::

[getPi(*digits*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the value of *pi* (*pi*, the mathematical constant defined as
the ratio of a circle\'s circumfrence to its diameter, approximately
3.14159265) to the given number of digits of precision. This is a static
method, so you can call this method directly on the BigNumber class
itself:

::: code
    x = BigNumber.getPi(10);
:::

The BigNumber class internally caches the value of *pi* to the highest
precision calculated so far during the program\'s execution, so this
routine only needs to compute the value when it is called with a higher
precision than that of the cached value.
:::

[getPrecision()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the number of digits of precision that this number stores. The
return value is of type integer.
:::

[getScale()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns an integer giving the base-10 scale of this number. If the
return value is positive, it indicates the number of digits before the
decimal point in the decimal representation of the number. If the return
value is zero, it indicates that the number has no whole part, and that
the first digit after the decimal point is non-zero (so the number is
greater than or equal to 0.1, and less than 1.0). If the return value is
negative, it indicates that the number has no whole part, and gives the
number of digits of zeros that immediately follow the decimal point
before the first non-zero digit. If the value of the number is exactly
zero, the return value is 1.
:::

[getWhole()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns BigNumber containing only the whole part of this number (the
digits before the decimal point). This doesn\'t do any rounding; it
simply truncates the number at the decimal point. For example,
[1.99999.getWhole()]{.code} returns [1.00000]{.code}.
:::

[isNegative()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns true if the number is less than zero, nil if the number is
greater than or equal to zero.
:::

[log10()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the base-10 logarithm of the number.
:::

[logE()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the natural logarithm of the number. The logarithm of a
non-positive number is not a real number, so this function throws a
run-time exception if the number is less than or equal to zero.
:::

[negate()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a number containing the arithmetic negative of this number.
:::

[numType()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns an integer with information on the type of the number. This lets
you identify the special values \"Not a Number\" (NaN) and Infinity.

The return value is an integer with a combination of the following bit
flags. Multiple flags may be returned, combined with [\|]{.code}. Use
[&]{.code} to test for a flag: [(n.numType() & NumTypeNAN)]{.code} is
non-zero if the \"not a number\" flag is set.

-   [NumTypeNum]{.code} - an ordinary number.
-   [NumTypeNAN]{.code} - Not a Number (NaN). This value is used in some
    floating point systems as the result from a calculation with an
    invalid input, such as sqrt(-1). BigNumber doesn\'t currently return
    this from any calculations, since any BigNumber function given an
    invalid argument value will instead throw an error. However, it\'s
    possible to construct BigNumber NaN values, such as by reading an
    IEEE 754-2008 NaN from a file via unpackBytes().
-   [NumTypePInf]{.code} - positive infinity. This is used in some
    floating point systems to represent overflows or the results of
    transcendental functions with infinite values, such as tan(pi/2). As
    with NaN, BigNumber calculations never return infinities; they throw
    overflow errors instead. However, you can construct Infinity values,
    such as by reading IEEE 754-2008 infinities via unpackBytes().
-   [NumTypeNInf]{.code} - negative infinity.
-   [NumTypeInf == NumTypePInf \| NumTypeNInf]{.code}. This is defined
    for your convenience, so that you can test for any infinity with a
    simpler expression; e.g., [(n.numType() & NumTypeInf) != 0]{.code}.
    Any given number will have only one of the positive or negative
    infinity flags set.
-   [NumTypePZero]{.code} - positive zero. Mathmetically, zero is
    neither positive nor negative, but the BigNumber representation
    retains a sign for all numbers, even zero. If this flag is set,
    [NumTypeNum]{.code} will also be set, since zero is an ordinary
    number.
-   [NumTypeNZero]{.code} - negative zero. A negative zero can result
    from a calculation that yields a negative value with an absolute
    value too small to store in the available precision. It can also be
    constructed by unpacking a negative zero IEEE 754-2008 value. The
    [NumTypeNum]{.code} flag will always be set if this flag is set.
-   [NumTypeZero == NumTypePZero \| NumTypeNZero]{.code}. This is
    defined for your convenience, so that you can test for any zero with
    a simpler expression; e.g., [n.numType() & NumTypeZero) !=
    0]{.code}. Any given number will have only one of the positive or
    negative zero flags set.
:::

[radiansToDegrees()]{.code}

::: fdef
Converts the value from degrees to radians and returns the number of
radians. This simply multiplies the value by (180/*pi*).
:::

[raiseToPower(*y*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the value of this number raised to the power *y* and returns
the result. If the value of the target number is negative, then *y* must
be an integer: if *x* \< 0, we can rewrite *x*^*y*^ as
(-1)^*y*^(-*x*)^*y*^, and we know that [-]{.code}*x* \> 0 because *x* \<
0. The result of raising -1 to a non-integer exponent cannot be
represented as a real number, hence this function throws an error if the
target number is negative. Note also that raising zero to any positive
exponent yields 0, and raising any value to the power 0 yields 1.
Raising 0 to an exponent of 0 is undefined; 0 raised to any negative
exponent is equivalent to the inverse of 0 to the absolute value of the
exponent, which is the same as 1/0, which throws a divide-by-zero
exception.
:::

[roundToDecimal(*places*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a number rounded to the given number of digits after the decimal
point. The new number has the same precision as this number, but all of
the digits after the given number of places after the decimal point will
be set to zero, and the last surviving digit will be rounded. If
*places* is zero, this simply rounds the number to an integer. If
*places* is less than zero, this rounds the number to a power of ten:
[roundToDecimal(-1)]{.code} rounds to the nearest multiple of ten,
[roundToDecimal(-2)]{.code} rounds to the nearest multiple of 100, and
so on. Note that the precision of the result is the same as the
precision of the original value; rounding merely affects the value, not
the stored precision.
:::

[scaleTen(*x*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a new number containing the value of this number scaled by
10^*x*^. If *x* is positive, this multiplies this number\'s value by ten
*x* times (so if *x* = 3, the result is this number\'s value times
1000). If *x* is negative, this divides this number\'s value by ten *x*
times. (This is more efficient than explicitly multiplying by ten,
because it simply adjusts the number\'s internal scale factor.)
:::

[setPrecision(*digits*)]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns a new number with the same value as this number but with the
specified number of digits of precision. If *digits* is higher than this
number\'s precision, the new value is simply extended with zeros in the
added trailing digits. If *digits* is lower than this number\'s
precision, the value is rounded to the given number of digits of
precision.
:::

[sine()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the trigonometric sine of the number (interpreted as a radian
value) and returns the result.

Note that the input value must be expressed in radians. If you are
working in degrees, you can convert to radians by multiplying your
degree values by (*pi*/180), since 180 degress equals *pi* radians. For
convenience, you can use the [degreesToRadians()]{.code} function to
perform this conversion.

Note also that this remainder calculation\'s precision is limited by the
precision of the original number itself, so a very large number with
insufficient precision to represent at least a few digits after the
decimal point (1.234e27, for example) will encounter a possibly
significant amount of rounding error, which will affect the accuracy of
the result. This should almost never be a problem in practice, because
there is usually little reason to compute angle values outside of plus
or minus a few times pi, but users should keep this in mind if they are
using very large numbers and the trigonometric functions yield
unexpected or inaccurate results.
:::

[sinh()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the hyperbolic sine of the number and returns the result.
:::

[sqrt()]{.code}

::: fdef
Returns the square root of the number. If the number is negative, this
function throws a run-time exception.
:::

[tangent()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the trigonometric tangent of the number (interpreted as a
radian value) and returns the result. Refer to the description of sine()
for notes on how the input precision affects the calculation.

Note that the tangent of (2*n*+1)\**pi*/2, where *n* is any integer,
(i.e., any odd multiple of *pi*/2) is undefined, and that the limit
approaching these values is plus or minus infinity. The BigNumber class
internally calculates the tangent as the sine divided by the cosine, and
as a result it is possible to generate a divide-by-zero exception by
evaluating the tangent at one of these values. However, in most cases,
because the input value cannot be exactly an odd multiple of *pi*/2
(because it isn\'t even theoretically possible to represent *pi* exactly
with a finite number of decimal digits), the tangent will return a
number with a very large absolute value.

[tanh()]{.code}

::: fdef
Computes the hyperbolic tangent of the number and returns the result.

## Precision and Scale

Each floating-point value that BigNumber represents has two important
attributes apart from its value: precision and scale. For the most part,
these are internal attributes that you can ignore; however, in certain
cases, it\'s useful to know how BigNumber uses these internally.

The scale of a BigNumber value is a multiplier that determines how large
the number really is. A BigNumber value stores a scale so that very
large and very small numbers can be represented compactly, without
storing all of the digits that would be necessary to write out the
numbers in decimal format. This is the same idea behind scientific
notation, where you write a number as a value between 1 and 10
multiplied by a power of ten; for example, we could write four hundred
fifty billion as 450,000,000,000, or more compactly in scientific
notation as 4.5e11. The \"e\" means \"times ten to the\", so 4.5e11
means 4.5 × 10^11^. (10^11^ is one hundred billion.) When we write a
number in scientific notation, we only need to write the significant
digits, so we can leave out all the extra trailing zeros of a very large
number. We can also use scientific notation to write numbers with very
small absolute values, by using negative exponents: 9.7e-9 is 9.7 ×
10^-9^; 10^-9^ is 1/(10^9^), or one one-billionth. Internally, a
BigNumber is stored just like this: it\'s stored as small number times a
power of ten. The power of ten is what we call the scale.

The precision of a BigNumber value is the number of decimal digits that
the value actually stores. A number\'s precision determines how many
distinct values it can have; the higher the precision, the more values
it can store, and hence the finer the distinctions it can make between
adjacent representable values. The precision is independent of the
scale; if you create a BigNumber value with only one digit of precision,
it\'s not limited to representing the values -9 through +9, because the
scale can allow it take on larger or smaller values. So, you can
represent arbitrarily large values regardless of a number\'s precision;
however, the precision limits the number of distinct values the number
can represent. So, for example, with one digit of precision, the next
representable value after 8000 is 9000.

[]{#intconv}When you create a BigNumber value, you can explicitly assign
it a precision by passing a precision specifier to the constructor. If
you don\'t specify a precision, BigNumber uses a default precision. If
you create a BigNumber value from an integer, the default precision is
32 digits. This includes \"implicit conversions\", where the system
automatically converts an integer to a BigNumber because the two types
are combined with an operator in an expression, such as [3.0 +
1000]{.code}.

If you create a BigNumber value from a string, the default precision is
exactly enough to store the value\'s significant digits. A significant
digit is a non-zero digit, or a zero that follows a non-zero digit.

Here are some examples:

-   [\'0012\']{.code} has two significant digits (the leading zeros are
    ignored).
-   [\'1.2000\']{.code} has five significant digits (the trailing zeros
    are significant because they follow non-zero digits).
-   [\'.00012\']{.code} has two significant digits (the leading zeros
    are ignored, even though they follow the decimal point).
-   [\'000.00012\']{.code} has two significant digits (leading zeros are
    ignored, whether they appear before or after the decimal point).
-   [\'1.00012\']{.code} has six significant digits (the zeros after the
    decimal point are significant because they follow a non-zero digit).
-   [\'3.20e06\']{.code} has three significant digits (the digits of the
    exponent, if specified, are not relevant to the number\'s
    precision).

When you use BigNumber values in calculations, the result in almost
every case has the same precision as the value operated upon. In
calculations involving two or more operands, the result has precision
equal to the greatest of the precisions of the operands. For example, if
you add a number with three digits of precision to a number with eight
digits of precision, the result will have eight digits of precision.
This has the desirable effect of preserving the precision of your values
in arithmetic, so that the precision you choose for your input data
values is carried forward throughout your calculations. For example,
consider this calculation:

::: code
    x = new BigNumber('3.1415');
    y = new BigNumber('0.000111');
    z = x + y;
:::

The exact arithmetic value of this calculation would be 3.1416111, but
this isn\'t the value that ends up in z, because the precision of the
operands limits the precision of the result. The precision of x is 5,
because it is created from a string with five significant digits. The
precision of y is 3. The result of the addition will have a precision of
5, because that\'s the larger of the two input precisions. So, the
result value stored in z will be 3.1416 - the additional two digits of y
are dropped, because they don\'t fit in the result value\'s 5 digits of
precision.

Precision limitations are fairly intuitive when the precision lost is
after the decimal point, but note that digits can also be dropped before
a decimal point. Consider this calculation:

::: code
    x = new BigNumber('7.25e3');
    y = new BigNumber('122');
    z = x + y;
:::

The value of x is 7.25e3, or 7250; this value has three digits of
precision. The value of y also has three digits of precision. The exact
result of the calculation is 7372, but the value stored in z will be
7370: the last digit of y is dropped because the result doesn\'t have
enough precision to represent it.

Note that calculations will in most cases round their result values when
they must drop precision from operand values. For example:

::: code
    x = new BigNumber('7.25e3');
    y = new BigNumber('127');
    z = x + y;
:::

The exact result would be 7377, but the value stored in z will be 7380:
the last digit of y is dropped, but the system rounds up the last digit
retained because the dropped digit is 5 or higher (in this case, 7).
