          This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new to TADS 3 and new to programming. The book opens with the basics of getting TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple game, so even if you’ve never done any programming before, this will help you get going quickly. The tutorial then leads you step by step through the design of three example games, showing how to use adv3Lite to implement the effects needed in the game. By the time you’re done, you’ll know your way around the system and you’ll be able to write your own games.

          Part tutorial and part reference, *Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite* is a perfect place to start for confident beginners, and for people with a little more programming experience. This book is designed for learning TADS on your terms - it’s organized by functional area, so once you’ve mastered the basics, you can skip around to focus on the areas you’re most interested in. As you develop your game, you can return to the book as a reference, to review the details of particular TADS features.

          *Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite* contains a number of exercises. Samples games suggesting solutions to some of these exercises may be found [here](learning/exercises.html). Alternatively you can treat these solutions as sample code illustrating various aspects of the adv3Lite library.

          TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language. These notes explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML formatting codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the TADS variant differs from standard HTML. (These are essentially just the original notes for HTML TADS 2, so they’re a little rough, but they are updated with relevant changes for TADS 3. Note that this isn’t an HTML tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to standard HTML, so you can learn it from any of the many tutorials on the Web for ordinary HTML.)
