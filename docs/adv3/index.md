|                                   | game, so even if you\'ve never    |

|                                   | by Michael Roberts                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as  |
|                                   | its formatting language. These    |
|                                   | notes explain how HTML fits into  |
|                                   | TADS, and how you can use HTML    |
|                                   | formatting codes for text         |
|                                   | effects, graphics, and sound, and |
|                                   | how the TADS variant differs from |
|                                   | standard HTML. (These are         |
|                                   | essentially just the original     |
|                                   | notes for HTML TADS 2, so         |
|                                   | they\'re a little rough, but they |
|                                   | are updated with relevant changes |
|                                   | for TADS 3. Note that this isn\'t |
|                                   | an HTML tutorial - but the HTML   |
|                                   | in TADS is pretty close to        |
|                                   | standard HTML, so you can learn   |
|                                   | it from any of the many tutorials |
|                                   | on the Web for ordinary HTML.)    |
