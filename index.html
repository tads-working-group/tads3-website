        <h1>Empowering Ambitious Authors</h1>
        <p>TADS 3 is a <em>powerful and flexible interactive fiction
            authoring system</em> designed and built for <em>ambitious authors</em>.
            It brings to the table a <em>powerful and dynamic</em> yet <em>fun to use</em> object-oriented
        language purpose built for writing interactive fiction, two advanced
        standard libraries that push the boundaries of what interactive fiction
            is capable of both in <em>simulation</em> and in <em>customizability</em>, as well as
            <em>unparalleled multimedia capabilities</em>.<br/><br/> </p>

                        <h3>Powerful</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Want to write a story with incredible simulational
                    sophistication, dynamic runtime capabilities, advanced
                    programming constructs, wild new game mechanics, or
                    something else? TADS is capable of entire categories of
                    feats impossible for other interactive fiction authoring
                    systems. Authors switching to TADS will find
                    new fields of imagination opened to them!</p>

                        <h3>Simulation-Oriented</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Interested in simulation? Both of TADS 3's standard
                    libraries come with rich and fully-featured world models
                    with all of the features you could possibly need for even
                    the most complex and simulation-heavy parser game. Nevertheless, if you don't need these
                    features, they fade into the background cleanly.</p>

                        directions? Although TADS 3's standard libraries come with
                        highly complex world models already, those assumptions are
                        just your starting point! TADS 3 is designed to make your
                        own code, the standard library code, and even the langauge
                        itself, flexible and extensible in a way that makes games
                        fun to write and easy to iterate on.</p>

                    <p>Already comfortable with programming? TADS 3 is designed
                    with advanced interactive fiction authors in mind, offering
                    the clarity, conciseness, and specificity of a fully-fledged
                    programming language with all the capabilities you would
                    expect and much more. TADS is confident in its authors'
                    ability to use complex, powerful, and advanced feature sets,
                    which enables it to do a lot more without worrying about
                    whether its users can keep up.</p>

            <p>TADS 3 is comprised of several core components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A <em><a href="http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/sysman/langsec.htm">special-purpose object-oriented programming language</a></em> designed
                with concise yet readable syntax and a focus on <em>extensibility</em>, <em>dynamic typing</em>, and <em>ease of defining new objects</em> (and
                sub-objects including contained and component objects) with
                custom properties and methods without having to declare a new
                class. The TADS 3 language makes growing and modifying your game &mdash; and the standard library! &mdash; fast,
                fun, and easy.</li>

                <li>Two powerful <em>text-adventure-specific <a href="https://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/index.htm">standard</a> <a href="https://faroutscience.com/adv3lite_docs/">libraries</a></em> containing <em>advanced world models</em> that have things
                    like <em>room parts</em>, <em>sense-passing</em>, a complex understanding of
                <em>attachable and detachable sub components and object
                    relationships</em>, and <em>hundreds of different powerful properties</em> to customize the precise
                behavior of each object, an advanced and extremely customizable
                parser that can understand arbitrary custom sentences, and
                perform user-customizable spell check &mdash; and more.</li>

                <li>A performant <em>compiler</em> to compile those programs,</li>

                <li>and an advanced <em>virtual machine</em> to run TADS programs and produce output.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In addition, there are also different kinds of <em>interpreters</em> that
            use the virtual machine to run your TADS games and then interpret
            the output produced by the games into the multimedia output and
            graphical user interface players see.</p>

            <p>To learn more about, and download, these components, see <a href="#install">below</a></p>

            <p>TADS 3 also has an <i>extensive</i> set of learning resources, including
                roughly <em>eight book-length references and guides</em>, all of
            which are many hundreds of detailed, orderly, and clear pages long.
            If you've struggled with the documentation of other interactive
            fiction authoring systems in the past, or are concerned that using
            such a niche piece of software will make answers hard to find, fear
            not! Michael J. Roberts and Eric Eve have ensured that no TADS
            programmer will ever stay confused for long. For more information on
            which manuals to read and where to find a full list of TADS
            documentation for each of the respective standard libraries, please

            <h2 id="interpreter">Getting an <em>interpreter</em></h2>

            <p>There are three types of TADS interpreters:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>HTML TADS interpeters</em>, which support the fully panoply of TADS' built-in
                    multimedia, interface, and virtual machine runtime features;</li>
                <li><em>text-only TADS interpreters</em>, which just ignore all the
                    multimedia commands and display only text, and which often do not
                    support the full runtime,</li>
                <li>and the <em>Web UI TADS interpreter</em>, which can be enabled in your game image so that when run, the game
                    will function as a server and serve up a full HTML TADS interpeter
                    into the web browser, with a lot of <a href="https://tads.org/t3doc/doc/sysman/webui.htm">extra</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/Otto73/TADS3">functionality</a>.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>HTML TADS</h3>
            <p>If you want to play or develop regular TADS 3 games the simplest
            and most supported way, we recommend going with
            an HTML TADS interpreter. Currently, the best one is <em><a
            href="https://realnc.github.io/qtads/#downloads">QTADS</a></em>,
            both because it is the most feature-complete and bug free, and
            because it is still being regularly updated and improved (at least
            as of May 17, 2023). It has versions available for Linux, Windows,
            and macOS.</p>

            <p>There is also the confusingly-named "HTML TADS" for Windows,
            available on the <a href="https://www.tads.org/t3dl/pksetup.exe">official TADS website</a>,
            which was the reference implementation for TADS interpreters but
            which has not been updated since at best 2013.</p>

            <h3>Text-only and Web UI</h3>
            <p>If you want to run the Web UI or just want to use a text-only
            interpreter, we recommend <em><a href="https://github.com/realnc/frobtads/releases">FrobTADS</a></em>,
            as it has the most complete implementation of the virtual
            machine/runtime and can run headless, so it makes sense to use as a
            server, and since it also has a nice text-only interpreter built in. FrobTADS
            has also been recently updated, reaching version 2.0 in 2021.</p>

            <h3>Text-only</h3>
            <p>The popular multi-format interpreter <em><a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/">Gargoyle</a></em> can
            also run TADS games, but it does so in text-only mode and is not
            capable of running a Web UI, so it is recommended not to use this
            unless you're just playing a few TADS games and don't care about the
            missing features.</p>

            <h2 id="compiler">Getting a <em>compiler</em></h2>
            <p>If you intend to develop TADS 3 games, you'll need a compiler to
            turn your source files into a game file that an interpreter can run.
            On Windows, you can use <em><a
            href="https://www.tads.org/tads3.htm#">the official Author's Kit for
            Windows</a></em>, although compatibility with modern 64-bit
            operating systems is in question. On macOS, Linux, or BSD, you can
            use <em><a href="https://github.com/realnc/frobtads/releases">FrobTADS</a></em>,
            which should run fine on modern machines.</p>

            <h2 id="editor">Setting up your <em>development environment</em></h2>

            <p>Although the TADS 3 Author's Kit for Windows comes with a full-fledged IDE called Workbench, that program is now very old and probably doesn't have all the features you're used to in a modern editor. As a result, across the board, we recommend one of two editors for
            writing TADS:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toerob.vscode-tads3tools">TADS 3 Tools for Visual Studio Code</a></em> offers
                a feature-rich and easy to use integrated development
                environment for TADS 3 authors, so if you have no specific
                editor preference or already use Visual Studio Code, it is
                highly recommended.</li>

                <li>There is also <em><a href="https://github.com/alexispurslane/tads3-mode">tads3-mode</a></em>
                for Emacs, which offers slightly better auto completion and most
                of the basic necessary capabilities to make a modern programmer
                feel at home, but which is admittedly not as advanced as TADS 3
                Tools. This is for relatively advanced authors who prefer not to
                use Visual Studio Code for whatever reason.</li>

                            <p>TADS 1.0 was written and designed by <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Michael_J._Roberts">Michael J. Roberts</a> and
                                released in September of 1990 as shareware under the imprint of "High Energy
                                Software", a company created by Roberts and his friend Steve McAdams, at a time
                                when the only other option for writing interactive fiction was <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/AGT">AGT</a>. It was fairly popular at the time, spawning a trilogy of shareware Zork homage/parodies that were "the most concerted and sustained effort at building a real business out of [the shareware IF scene]" at
                                the time.<sup><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/02/tads/">1</a></sup></p>

                            <p>By the time of TADS 2.2.1, released in October of 1996, due to a
                                lack of money in the shareware business, TADS was released as
                                freeware: although not stricty free software, since forks and modifications for
                                the purpose of anything but porting were verboten, free
                                use, copying, and distribution were now allowed.</p>

                            <p>Also <a href="https://github.com/tajmone/tads-sources">open source</a> freeware,
                            TADS 3, first released on September 15, 2006, was
                            designed by <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/Michael_J._Roberts">Michael J. Roberts</a> as
                                a brand new revitalization superceding TADS 2. Despite being
                                released in the early oughts, TADS 3 still pushes the boundaries of
                                interactive fiction authoring system capabilities and world models
                                in many ways, including with runtime object cloning and creation,
                                multi-channel audio capabilities, and sense-passing for any kind of
                                sense, even user-defined ones. The core appeal of TADS goes beyond
                                specific features, however.</p>

            <p>If you want to learn more about the history of TADS, I recommend checking out the Digital Antiquarian's article <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/02/tads/">here</a>.
            Unfortunately, that article only covers the early history, and what
            we know of the rest is spotty at best.</p>

        <p>This is an unofficial informational website made by fans of the TADS 3
        authoring system in an attempt to spread the word about what we believe
        to be an underappreciated system, and provide a repository for more up
        to date information than is contained on the original <a href="https://tads.org">tads.org</a> website,
        which hasn't been updated since roughly 2013. For more information,
        however, definitely go check out that website too, as there is a lot of
        content there that we haven't covered here, just as there is content
