Set](tadsnet.htm)    

# tads-io Function Set

The tads-io function set provides access to the user interface provided
by the TADS 3 Interpreter host applications, as well as file
input/output functions. The tads-io function set is available only in T3
implementations that are hosted within a TADS 3 Interpreter environment,
so a program that uses this function set will only run in a TADS
Interpreter.

The tads-io function set is separate from the tads-gen function set to
allow programmers to choose an alternative input/output and user
interface function set, if desired, while still using the more general
tads-gen functions. Most programs will probably want to use the tads-gen
set because of the many data conversion and manipulation functions it
contains, even if they're using an alternative user interface.

To use this set of functions in your program, \#include \<tadsio.h\>, or
simply \#include \<tads.h\> (which includes both \<tadsio.h\> and
\<tadsgen.h\>, for the full set of TADS intrinsics). If you're using the
adv3 library, you can simply \#include \<adv3.h\>, since that
automatically includes the basic system headers.

## Banner API

The tads-io function set incorporates a set of functions known as the
Banner API. These functions let you divide the interpreter's application
window into several independent subwindows. The adv3 library uses this
to implement a number of special UI effects, including the standard
adventure game "status line" feature.

Using the Banner API requires some knowledge of the underlying display
model, which is described in detail in the [Banner Model](banners.htm)
section.

## tads-io functions

bannerClear(*handle*)

Clears the banner's display. Removes all text from the banner, and moves
the output position back to the upper left corner of the banner's
window.

bannerCreate(*parent*, *where*, *other*, *windowType*, *align*, *size*,
*sizeUnits*, *style*)

Creates a new banner window with the given parameters.

*parent* is the handle of an existing banner that is to serve as the
parent of the new banner, or nil if the new banner is to be a child of
the main game window. The new banner's space is obtained by splitting
the parent window.

*where* and *other* together indicate where the banner goes in the
parent's list of children, which determines how the new banner is laid
out relative to the other children of the same parent (see the screen
Layout overview above). *where* can be one of the following values:

- BannerFirst - indicates that the new banner is the first child of
  *parent*. *other* is not used in this case.
- BannerLast - indicates that the new banner is the last child of
  *parent*. *other* is not used.
- BannerBefore - indicates that the new banner should be inserted into
  the child list immediately before *other*, which must be the handle of
  an existing child of *parent*.
- BannerAfter - indicates that the new banner should be inserted into
  the child list immediately after *other*, which must be the handle of
  an existing child of *parent*.

Note that the child list order specified via where and other is not
permanent; it merely determines where the new banner goes in the current
child list of the given parent. For example, specifying BannerFirst does
not mean that the banner will remain the first child forever; it merely
puts it at the start of the current list. If banner A is created with
BannerFirst specified, and later banner B is created with BannerFirst,
banner A will become the second child after B.

If BannerBefore or BannerAfter is specified, and *other* is not a valid
banner handle or is not a child of the given parent, then the system
ignores *where* and *other* and inserts the banner as the last child of
the parent, as though BannerLast had been specified.

The *windowType* parameter indicates the type of banner to create; this
is one of the following (see "Banner Types" above for more information):

- BannerTypeText - an ordinary text window. This type of window behaves
  essentially the same way as the main game window; in particular, it
  interprets HTML to the same extent that the main game window does.
- BannerTypeTextGrid - a "text grid" window, which simulates a
  character-mode terminal window by displaying a rectangular array of
  characters.

The *align* value indicates how the banner's space is carved out of its
parent's space. This can have one of the following values:

- BannerAlignTop - the banner goes at the top of the parent's space
- BannerAlignBottom - the banner goes at the bottom of the parent's
  space
- BannerAlignLeft - the banner goes at the left of the parent's space
- BannerAlignRight - the banner goes at the right of the parent's space

The *size* parameter gives the initial size of the banner, the meaning
of which depends on *sizeUnits*:

- BannerSizePercent - the size is a percentage of the parent's space as
  it is just before carving out this banner. *size* is a value from 0
  to 100. The banner will remember that its size is a percentage;
  whenever the overall display area size changes (for example, whenever
  the user resizes the main application window for the interpreter), the
  size of the banner on-screen will be refigured as the same percentage
  of the new available space.
- BannerSizeAbsolute - the size is given in the "natural units" of the
  banner, which depend upon the window type:
  - For a text window (BannerTypeText), the size is given in character
    rows or columns. The size of each character can vary if the window
    uses a proportional font or can display multiple fonts, so for
    consistency we define this unit as the size of a "0" character in
    the window's default (initial) font. To compute the actual pixel
    size of the window, the system will take into account space needed
    for interior margins and borders; this ensures that the window will
    be large enough to show the requested number of rows or columns of
    text. (Note, however, that a banner of size 0 will not add any
    internal space, since a zero-sized banner has no screen presence at
    all.)
  - For a text grid window (BannerTypeTextGrid), the size is given in
    rows or columns in the grid's fixed-pitch font. As with a text
    window, the space needed for margins and borders will be added to
    the requested row/column size.

*style* is a combination of flag values specifying the desired behavior
for the banner. Some of the style flags directly indicate particular
aspects of the on-screen appearance of the banner; other styles are
advisory, giving the interpreter some hints about how you're planning to
use the banner, so that the interpreter can select appearance or
behavior variations that are appropriate to the current platform. Not
all interpreters support all styles, so you have to think of the style
flags as hints to the interpreter about the desired appearance, rather
than a specification of the actual appearance. After you create the
banner, you can use bannerGetInfo() to retrieve the actual style flags,
which will give you some indication of how the interpreter treated your
request.

The style flags are:

- BannerStyleBorder - show the banner with a border, which is to say a
  line on the banner's inner edge (the edge nearest the main text
  window: for a BannerAlignTop banner, this will be the banner's bottom
  edge). Most character-mode interpreters do not support this style,
  because drawing a border would consume an entire character row or
  column and would thus take up too much space visually.
- BannerStyleVScroll - show the banner with a vertical scrollbar, if the
  system has scrollbars. Character-mode platforms will usually ignore
  this flag.
- BannerStyleHScroll - show the banner with a horizontal scrollbar, if
  possible.
- BannerStyleAutoVScroll - whenever new text is displayed in the banner,
  and the new text would appear outside of the on-screen boundaries of
  the banner, scroll the banner's contents vertically to bring the
  latest text into view. If this style isn't set, the banner won't
  automatically scroll vertically (if it has a vertical scrollbar,
  though, the user will be able to scroll it manually).
- BannerStyleAutoHScroll - when new text is displayed in the banner,
  scroll the banner's contents horizontally if necessary to bring the
  new text into view.
- BannerStyleTabAlign - the \<TAB\> tag is needed for text alignment
  purposes in the new window. This flag won't change the appearance of
  the banner in a full HTML interpreter or in most character-mode
  interpreters, but for text-only interpreters running on GUI systems
  where proportional fonts are available, this might force the
  interpreter to use a fixed-pitch font for the banner so that it can
  use spaces to implement the tab alignment.
- BannerStyleMoreMode - use "more" mode in the banner. This implies the
  BannerStyleAutoVScroll style. In "more" mode, the interpreter pauses
  whenever new text written to the banner is about to force older text
  to scroll out of view, to ensure that the user has had a chance to
  read all of the text before it scrolls away. The exact user interface
  varies by platform; on most systems, the interpreter displays a prompt
  message, such as "\[More\]", in the window that's about to overflow,
  then waits for the user to press a key. This style allows a banner
  window to be used to display long passages without worrying about
  whether or not the text will fit in the user's available display area.
- BannerStyleHStrut - makes the banner a "horizontal strut" when
  bannerSizeToContents() is used to set the parent banner's width. If
  the child banner is a vertical banner (i.e., it has left or right
  alignment), the width of the child's contents is added to the width of
  the parent's contents to determine the overall content width. If the
  child banner is a horizontal banner (top or bottom alignment),
  bannerSizeToContents() will set the parent's width to the larger of
  the widths of the parent's or child's contents.
- BannerStyleVStrut - makes the banner a "vertical strut" when
  bannerSizeToContents() is used to set the parent banner's width. This
  has the same effect on height that BannerStyleHStrut has on width.

This function returns a handle to the new banner, or nil if an error
occurs creating the banner. The banner handle can be used to operate on
the banner in other bannerXxx() functions.

bannerDelete(*handle*)

Delete the given banner. This removes the banner from the display, and
recalculates the layout for all of the other banners remaining on the
screen. After this function is called, the banner handle becomes invalid
and must not be used for anything else.

Note that any children of the banner being deleted will immediately
become invisible. They will remain valid, so you can continue to pass
their handles to banner functions, but they will not have any display
presence. A banner always obtains its display space by splitting its
parent, so once the parent is gone, a child has no way of obtaining any
screen space of its own and thus becomes invisible.

bannerFlush(*handle*)

Flushes the text output buffer for the given banner, immediately
updating the display with any pending text.

bannerGetInfo(*banner*)

Retrieves information on the banner. This function returns a list of
values, as follows:

- \[1\] - the window's alignment type (a BannerAlignXxx value)
- \[2\] - the window's actual style (a bit-wise combination of
  BannerStyleXxx flags). This can be used to determine how the styles
  originally requested were interpreted by the local platform. In some
  cases, it might be desirable to take some special action if a given
  style flag wasn't honored; for example, if a border was requested but
  the actual style flags indicate that no border is displayed, the
  program might want to use a different background color in the banner
  to make the banner's screen area stand out from the adjacent window's.
- \[3\] - the height of the banner's screen area, in text rows. For GUI
  platforms, this is an estimate only, since the size of text can vary
  on these platforms; the estimate will give the number of lines of text
  in the window's default font that will fit in the window's height,
  which might be considerably different than the number of lines
  actually displayed.
- \[4\] - the width of the banner's screen area, in text columns. As
  with the height, this is only an estimate on GUI platforms, since the
  banner might use proportionally-spaced characters and might use
  several different fonts; the estimate gives the number of digit 0's,
  in the window's default font, that will fit in the window's width.
- \[5\] - the pixel height of the banner. This is meaningful only on GUI
  platforms; on character-mode platforms, this will always be zero.
- \[6\] - the pixel width of the banner. This is used on GUI platforms
  only; on character-mode platforms, this will always be zero.

bannerGoTo(*handle*, *row*, *col*)

Move the output position in the given text grid banner to the given row
and column. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 at the upper left
corner. This function can be used only in text grid windows; in other
types of windows, it has no effect.

bannerSay(*handle*, ...)

Writes one or more text items to the banner. This function treats the
parameters following *handle* the same way that tadsSay() does.

bannerSetScreenColor(*handle*, *color*)

Set the background color in the banner. This immediately changes the
entire window's background to the given color (in other words, this
doesn't merely affect subsequent text, but also affects everything
already displayed in the banner). The color values are the same as for
bannerSetTextColor(), except that ColorTransparent is not meaningful
here. This function can't be used in ordinary text windows
(BannerTypeText); use the HTML \<BODY BGCOLOR\> tag instead.

bannerSetSize(*handle*, *size*, *sizeUnits*, *isAdvisory*)

Set the size of the banner. The *size* and *sizeUnits* parameters have
the same meanings they do in bannerCreate(). If *isAdvisory* is true, it
indicates that the size setting is only an estimate, and that a call to
bannerSizeToContents() will be made later; in this case, the interpreter
might simply ignore this estimated size setting entirely, to avoid
unnecessary redrawing. Platforms that do not support contents-based
sizing will always set the estimated size, even when isAdvisory is true.
If *isAdvisory* is nil, the platform will set the banner size as
requested; set *isAdvisory* to nil when you will not follow up with a
call to bannerSizeToContents().

bannerSetTextColor(*handle*, *fg*, *bg*)

Set the text color in the given banner to the given foreground (*fg*)
and background (*bg*) colors. The new color settings are used for text
subsequently displayed; any text already displayed is not affected. This
can't be used in ordinary text windows (BannerTypeText); use the HTML
\<FONT COLOR\> tag instead.

*fg* and *bg* can have the following values:

- ColorText - the default text foreground color (usually a user
  preference setting)
- ColorTextBg - the default text background color
- ColorStatusText - the default "status line" text color
- ColorStatusBg - the default status line background color
- ColorInput - the default input text color
- ColorRGB(*r*, *g*, *b*)} - the specific color given as with red,
  green, and blue component values; each component can vary from 0
  to 255. ColorRGB(0,0,0) is black, and ColorRGB(255,255,255) is white.
- ColorBlack, ColorWhite, ColorRed, ColorBlue, ColorGreen, ColorYellow,
  ColorCyan, ColorAqua, ColorMagenta, ColorSilver, ColorGray,
  ColorMaroon, ColorPurple, ColorFuchsia, ColorLime, ColorOlive,
  ColorNavy, and ColorTeal provide the standard set of HTML-defined
  colors. These are all convenience macros that simply use ColorRGB()
  with the corresponding HTML RGB values.

In addition, the special value ColorTransparent can be used for the
background color. This indicates that the text should be drawn with a
transparent background, and thus should simply be drawn against the
banner's current background color.

bannerSizeToContents(*handle*)

Resizes the given banner based on the current contents of the banner.
For a top-aligned or bottom-aligned banner, this sets the banner's
height so that the banner is just tall enough to show all of the
contents as currently laid out. For a left-aligned or right-aligned
banner, this sets the banner's width so that the banner is just wide
enough to hold the banner's single widest indivisible element (such as a
single word or a picture). This routine can be used to set the banner's
size based on the actual size of the contents; it's impossible to know
the exact size of a banner's contents until you actually display the
contents, because the sizes of fonts and other display elements vary
from one machine to another, and can even change on the same machine in
response to user preference settings and other factors.

Note that this routine might not be implemented on all platforms; on
platforms where it's not implemented, it's legal to call this routine,
but the function will have no effect. To ensure that a reasonable size
is always set regardless of platform, callers should always use
bannerSetSize() to set an approximate size, passing true for the
*isAdvisory* flag, and then call bannerSizeToContents() to set the exact
content-based size. On platforms where bannerSizeToContents() is
supported, this will set the exact content-based size; on other
platforms, this will at least set the size to a suitable approximation.

clearScreen()

Clear the main console window, if possible. The actual effect of this
function varies by system; some interpreters clear the window, some
display enough newlines to scroll any existing text off the top of the
window, and some ignore the call completely.

flushOutput()

Immediately flushes text to the output. When you display output using
tadsSay(), the text you write isn't necessarily displayed immediately,
because the output formatter generally buffers text internally; the
exact details of the output formatter's internal buffering vary by
platform. The flushOutput() function tells the output formatter to
display any buffered text immediately. It is never necessary to call
this function, because the formatter automatically flushes its buffers
before waiting for user input. It is, however, sometimes desirable to be
able to display buffered output explicitly; for example, if your program
is going to perform some computation that will take a while, you might
want to ensure that the user sees a "please wait" message before the
long-running computation begins.

This function takes no arguments and returns no value.

getLocalCharSet(*which*)

Returns a string giving the name of the active local character set
selected by *which*, which can have one of the following values:

- CharsetDisplay - returns the name of the character set displayed on
  the monitor and read from the keyboard. If the interpreter was started
  with an explicit character set option (the "-cs" option in the
  command-line interpreter, for example), the character set name so
  specified is returned; otherwise, the local default display character
  set name is returned.
- CharsetFileName - returns the name of the character set used in the
  file system for filenames. In some cases, this might differ from the
  display character set; for example, a system might have a global file
  system character set used by all applications, but allow individual
  terminal or window sessions to use separate character sets for the
  user interface.
- CharsetFileCont - returns the name of the character set typically used
  for the contents of text files on the local system. Note that this is
  only a default; a particular file could be in any character set,
  determined at the time the file was created. However, on most systems,
  there's a character set that's used by convention for most text files.

If *which* is not one of the above values, the function returns nil.

The character set name returned can be used to create a
[CharacterSet](charset.htm) object to perform character-to-byte and
byte-to-character mappings.

inputDialog(*icon*, *prompt*, *buttons*, *defaultButton*,
*cancelButton*)

Displays an "alert box" dialog (also known as a "message box"), and
waits for the user to respond. This displays a dialog that includes a
short message for the user to read, an icon indicating the general
nature of the condition that gave rise to the dialog (an error, a
warning, a choice for the user to make, etc.), and a set of push-buttons
that dismiss the dialog and (in some cases) let the user choose among
options.

On GUI systems, this will use a standard system dialog if the OS
provides. On character-mode systems, this will generally not display a
GUI-style dialog, but will simply display the prompt string and let the
user type a response.

*icon* gives the type of icon to show in the dialog, if any; *prompt* is
the message string to display; *buttons* gives the set of buttons to
display; *defaultButton* is the index (starting at 1) among the buttons
of the default button; and *cancelButton* is the index of the
cancellation button.

The *icon* value can be one of the following:

- InDlgIconNone - no icon
- InDlgIconWarning - "warning" icon; indicates a possible problem but
  not a serious error
- InDlgIconInfo - "information" icon; indicates that the message is for
  information only, and doesn't indicate an error or warning
- InDlgIconQuestion - "question" icon; indicates that the program is
  requesting information from the user
- InDlgIconError - "error" icon; indicates that an error has occurred

The *buttons* value can be one of the constants listed below, to select
a standard set of buttons:

- InDlgOk - show only an "OK" button
- InDlgOkCancel - show "OK" and "Cancel" buttons
- InDlgYesNo - show "Yes" and "No" buttons
- InDlgYesNoCancel - show "Yes", "No", and "Cancel" buttons

Alternatively, *buttons* can be a list (or a [list-like
object](opoverload.htm#listlike)) specifying a custom set of buttons.
Each element of the list is either a string giving a custom label for
the button, or one of the InDlgLblXxx values listed below to select a
standard label. The standard labels should be used when possible, as
these will be automatically localized; labels given explicitly as
strings will be used exactly as given. If a list of custom button labels
is given, the buttons are displayed in the dialog in the order of the
list (usually left to right, but this could vary according to system
conventions and localization).

Each custom button label string can incorporate an ampersand (&). The
letter immediately following the ampersand, if provided, is used as the
keyboard shortcut for the button. This is particularly important on
character-mode systems, where the "dialog" is typically shown merely as
a text prompt, and the user responds by selecting the letter of the
desired option. Typically, you should use the first character of a
button label as its keyboard shortcut, but this obviously won't work
when two button labels have the same first letter; in these cases, you
should choose another letter from the button label, preferably something
like the first letter of the second word of the button label, or the
first letter of the stressed syllable of the most important word of the
label.

The button label constants are:

- InDlgLblOk - "OK" button
- InDlgLblCancel - "Cancel"
- InDlgLblYes - "Yes"
- InDlgLblNo - "No"

The return value is the index among the buttons of the button that the
user selects to dismiss the dialog. The function doesn't return until
the user selects one of the buttons.

If an error occurs, the return value is 0. In most cases, this means
that the user has closed the game window or disconnected the terminal
session. It can also indicate a resource error, such as the system being
too low on memory to display the dialog, although this is rare on modern
systems. (There's no way to distinguish end-of-file and resource errors,
but that's not too important because in either case the best course of
action for the game is simply to exit.)

inputEvent(*timeout*?)

Wait for an event, with the optional *timeout*, given in milliseconds.
If the *timeout* value is omitted or nil, there is no timeout, so the
function waits indefinitely for an event.

The function returns when either an event occurs or the timeout expires.
The return value is a list containing one or more elements. The first
element of the list is a constant that indicates the type of event that
occurred; the remaining elements of the list vary according to the event
type. The event type codes are:

- InEvtKey - the user pressed a key. The second element of the list is a
  string giving the key pressed. The string returns varies according to
  the type of key.

  For a regular character key, this is simply the character. For
  example, if the user presses the A key with no Shift key or Caps Lock
  in effect, the returned string is simply 'a'. If the user holds down
  the Shift key and presses B, the returned string is 'B'.

  For the standard non-printing keys, the corresponding ASCII control
  character is returned: for the Tab key, '\t'; for the Return or Enter
  key, '\n'. Note that '\n' is returned for Return or Enter *regardless*
  of the local system's newline conventions, so you don't have to worry
  about the different conventions used on different systems.

  For "special" keys - cursor arrows, "F" keys, and the like - the
  returned string is a portable name for the key. The special key names
  are assigned by TADS, so they're the same on every system - you don't
  have to worry about the hardware or OS-specific representations of
  these keys, because TADS maps the local representation into these
  universal key names. Special key names are always enclosed in square
  brackets, so you can easily distinguish them from ordinary character
  keys. The key names are:

  \[alt-a\]

  Alt-A (i.e., the "Alt" key plus the letter A); likewise for \[alt-b\],
  \[alt-1\], etc.

  \[ctrl-a\]

  Ctrl-A (i.e., the "Ctrl" or "Control" key plus the letter A); likewise
  for \[ctrl-b\], \[ctrl-c\], etc.

  \[esc\]

  the "Escape" or "Esc" key

  \[up\]

  the "up" cursor arrow

  \[down\]

  the "down" cursor arrow

  \[right\]

  the "right" cursor arrow

  \[left\]

  the "left" cursor arrow

  \[home\]

  the "Home" key

  \[end\]

  the "End" key

  \[del-word\]

  the "Delete Word" key

  \[del-eol\]

  the "delete to end of line" key

  \[del-line\]

  the "delete line" key

  \[insert\]

  the "Insert" or "Ins" key

  \[del\]

  the "Delete" or "Del" key

  \[scroll\]

  the "scroll lock" key

  \[page up\]

  the "Page Up" or "Previous Page" key

  \[page down\]

  the "Page Down" or "Next Page" key

  \[top\]

  the "Top of Document" key

  \[bottom\]

  the "Bottom of Document"

  \[f1\]

  function key F1; likewise for \[f2\], \[f3\], etc.

  \[bksp\]

  the Backspace key

  \[word-left\]

  the "Word Left" or "Previous Word" key

  \[word-right\]

  the "Word Right" or "Next Word" key

  \[eof\]

  the "End of File" key

  \[break\]

  the "Break" key

  \[?\]

  any other key

  Note that you can't count on any of the special keys to be available
  on every machine. Some keyboards simply have no equivalents for some
  of these keys. Furthermore, even on systems that do have all of these
  keys, some of them might have special meanings, due to hardware, the
  operating system, or other software; so a keystroke might be
  intercepted before it ever reaches inputEvent(). For example, certain
  Ctrl+Letter keys and F-keys have special meanings in the Windows HTML
  TADS interpreter because they're assigned as menu command keys (also
  known as "accelerators" or "shortcuts"); Windows intercepts these keys
  and activates their special meanings before inputEvent() has a chance
  to read them, so they'll never generate events that inputEvent() can
  read.

  Because you can't count on any given special key to be available to
  every user, you should avoid hard-wiring these keys into your program.
  For maximum portability, you should either (a) give users a way of
  customizing the keyboard layout, so that they can select the special
  keys that work properly on their keyboards, or (b) provide ordinary
  letter or number key equivalents for any special keys you use. The
  menu system module (menusys.t) in the Adv3 library uses the latter
  approach: it lets the user use the cursor arrow keys to navigate menu
  screens, but also assigns alphabetic equivalents: "U" for up, "D" for
  down, "P" for previous menu.

- InEvtTimeout - the timeout expired

- InEvtHref - the user clicked on a hyperlink (i.e., text or graphics
  displayed in a window with an HTML \<A HREF=xxx\>\> tag). The second
  element of the list is a string giving the text of the HREF attribute
  of the hyperlink that was clicked.

- InEvtNoTimeout - this isn't an event, but rather an error code: it
  indicates that the platform doesn't support the timeout feature of
  inputEvent(). When inputEvent() is called with a timeout value on a
  platform that doesn't support the timeout feature, the function simply
  returns this result code immediately.

- InEvtEof - an "end of file" error has occurred. This indicates that
  the program is in the process of terminating. This happens, for
  example, when the user explicitly terminates the interpreter program
  (by closing its main window in the GUI, for example), or when the OS
  is terminating programs in preparation for shutting down the computer.
  This event type indicates that no further input will be available.

Note that new events could be added in the future, so be aware that your
code might receive events that aren't on this list. It should always be
safe to simply ignore an event you don't recognize or don't want to
process; the purpose of events is to notify the program that something
has happened, so the interpreter should always be able to carry on with
its own processing whether or not your code does anything in response to
a particular event.

inputFile(*prompt*, *dialogType*, *fileType*, *flags*)

Display a file selector dialog and wait for the user to respond. On GUI
systems, this displays a standard system file selector dialog; on
text-only platforms, this generally just displays the prompt text and
waits for the user to type a filename.

*prompt* is the message string to display in the dialog, to let the user
know the purpose of the file selection. On many GUI systems, the
physical display area allotted for this message is fairly small, so it's
best to keep it short: "Saved game file" or "Log file," for instance.
There's usually not any need for a long, detailed message anyway, since
in most cases the user will already know what the dialog is for simply
because they just initiated the action that triggered the dialog. For
example, if the user types SAVE, they'll expect to be asked for a name
for the saved game.

*dialogType* is one of the InFileXxx constants below, specifying whether
the request is to select an existing file or to specify the name for a
new file. *fileType* is one of the FileTypeXxx constants below, giving
the format of the file being requested; this is used on some systems to
filter the displayed list of existing files so that only files of the
same format are included, to reduce clutter.

*flags* is reserved for future use and should be set to zero.

The constants for *dialogType* are:

- InFileOpen - "open" dialog: selects an existing file
- InFileSave - "save" dialog: selects a name for a file to be created

The constants for *fileType* are:

- FileTypeLog - log (transcript) file
- FileTypeData - TADS 2 private binary data format
- FileTypeCmd - command input file
- FileTypeText - text
- FileTypeBin - unknown binary data
- FileTypeUnknown - unknown type
- FileTypeT3Image - TADS 3 image file (i.e., a compiled TADS 3 program,
  a .t3 file)
- FileTypeT3Save - TADS 3 saved state file

The return value is a list. The first element is an integer giving the
status, and additional elements vary according to the status code. The
status codes are:

- InFileSuccess indicates that the user successfully selected a file.
  The following additional elements are in the returned list:

  - \[2\] = the selected file name, as a [FileName](filename.htm) object
  - \[3\] = nil (reserved for future use)
  - \[4\] = warning message string, or nil

  The warning message string in element \[4\] is non-nil only if the
  file selection was read from a script, *and* the script reader
  detected a possible error condition for the file name, *and* the
  script reader didn't display the warning itself. The script reader
  checks the selection from an Open dialog to make sure the file exists,
  and checks the selection from a Save dialog to make sure the file
  *doesn't* already exist (to protect against accidentally overwriting
  an existing file) and that it's possible to create and write to the
  file. If any of these tests fail for scripted input, the script reader
  generates a suitable warning message. In the conventional console UI,
  the script reader automatically displays these warning messages
  itself, so games built for the traditional UI don't have to concern
  themselves with this. However, in the Web UI, it's not possible for
  the script reader to display these warnings itself, since the script
  reader doesn't have access to the Web UI communications channels.
  Instead, it returns the warning text to the caller via this return
  list element. The caller is responsible for displaying the warning to
  the user in this case.

  To allow for localization, the error message starts with a two-letter
  error code, followed by a space, followed by the English text of the
  message. Localized libraries can replace the message text based on the
  two-letter error code:

  - OV - the script might overwrite an existing file (Save dialog)
  - WR - the file can't be created/written (Save dialog)
  - RD - the file doesn't exist (Open dialog)

- InFileFailure indicates a system error of some kind showing the
  dialog. There are no additional return list elements.

- InFileCancel indicates that the user explicitly canceled the dialog
  (such as by clicking a "Cancel" button in the UI). There are no
  additional return list elements.

Files selected with inputFile() are granted special permissions that
bypass the [file safety](terp.htm#file-safety) settings. The program is
allowed to read a file selected with an Open dialog, and is allowed to
write a file selected with a Save dialog, even if the file safety
settings would normally prohibit access to the same file. The special
extra permissions are granted because of the direct interaction with the
user; the user is asked to select a file to read or write, so the act of
selecting the file expresses an intention to allow that operation. (The
visual presentation of the dialog is under system control, so the game
program can't deceive the user about the basic read or write operation
being proposed. It could use the prompt message to lie about the purpose
of the file access, but it can't lie about the basic nature of the
access.) The special permission is stored as an internal attribute of
the [FileName](filename.htm) object returned by inputFile() function, so
you have to use the actual FileName object returned to exercise the
special permission. For example, converting the FileName to a string and
then attempting to open the file via the string will revert to the
ordinary file safety rules for the file.

inputKey()

Read a keystroke from the user. Waits for the user to press a key, then
returns a string with the key the user pressed.

This function returns a string indicating which key the user pressed.
The key strings have the same meaning as for an InEvtKey event from
inputEvent().

inputLine()

Read a line of text input from the user. Returns the text of the input
as a string. (The returned string will **not** contain a newline
character.) Returns nil if an "end of file" error occurs, which usually
indicates that the user has closed the interpreter application.

inputLineCancel(*reset*)

Cancels an editing session interrupted by a timeout. This function must
be called after inputLineTimeout() returns the InEvtTimeout event code
if any display input or output is to be performed before the next call
to inputLineTimeout(). This function terminates the editing session,
making any changes to the visual display that would have occurred if the
user had terminated the command entry by pressing the Return key or some
equivalent action. For example, this function changes the display by
starting a new line of text after the line that was being edited.

The *reset* argument indicates whether or not inputLineTimeout() should
forget the editing state that was in effect when the timeout occurred.
If *reset* is true, then the next call to inputLineTimeout() will start
with a blank input line; if reset is nil, then the next call to
inputLineTimeout() will re-display the line of text that was under
construction when the timeout occurred, and will restore the editing
state (cursor position, selected text range, and so on) that was in
effect.

inputLineTimeout(*timeout*?)

Read a line of text input from the user, with an optional *timeout*
given in milliseconds. See the section on real-time input
[below](#rtinput) for examples of how to use this function. If *timeout*
is missing or is nil, there is no time limit on the input.

This function might not be implemented on every platform, because some
platforms do not have the necessary operating system features to support
it. If a platform does not support the timeout feature, this function
will return an InEvtNoTimeout pseud-event immediately upon invocation if
*timeout* is given as a non-nil value.

The return value is a list, the first element of which gives an event
code. Additional elements vary according to the event type. The event
codes are:

- InEvtEof - end of file reading the input. This indicates that the
  application is being terminated or that an error occurred reading the
  keyboard. The result list has no additional elements.
- InEvtLine - a line of input was successfully read from the keyboard.
  This event is returned when the user expressly enters the line of text
  by pressing the Return key or performing some other action that
  terminates the editing, such as clicking on a hyperlink or selecting a
  command from a menu. When this event code is returned, the second
  element of the result list contains a string giving the text entered.
- InEvtTimeout - the timeout interval expired before the user finished
  editing the line of text. The second element of the result list is a
  string giving the line of text under construction.
- InEvtNoTimeout - indicates that the timeout feature is not supported
  on the local system. The timeout feature is not universally supported.
  The caller will have to use inputLine() in this case; real-time input
  interruptions will not be available.
- InEvtEndQuietScript - indicates that the input reader had been
  returning text from a "quiet" input script file, such as a script
  being read using the "-i" option of the command-line interpreter. When
  a script is read in "quiet" mode, the interpreter suppresses all text
  display while the script is being processed, so no input or output is
  displayed on the console. The interpreter returns a specific event for
  this case because any prompting text previously displayed for this
  input line will not have been shown, since the quiet mode will have
  suppressed the prompt text along with any other output; this event
  allows the caller to re-display the prompt now that script input has
  ended and regular keyboard input will be resumed, so that the user
  will see a command-line prompt and thus know that the interpreter is
  waiting for new input.

When this function returns the InEvtTimeout event code, the caller must
not perform any display input or output operations in the same window
until after calling inputLineCancel(), with the single exception that
the caller can call inputLineTimeout() again with no intervening call to
inputLineCancel().

After a timeout occurs, if inputLineTimeout() is called again with no
intervening call to inputLineCancel(), then inputLineTimeout() resumes
editing the interrupted command line. In this case, there is no visible
effect of the timeout; from the user's perspective, the timeout never
occurred. This allows the program to carry out background operations
silently while the user edits a command line.

If a timeout occurs and inputLineCancel(nil) is subsequently called,
then inputLineTimeout() is called again, the new call to
inputLineTimeout() re-displays the command line as it was at the time of
interruption, and then allows the user to resume editing where they left
off. In this case, there is a visible change to the display, in that the
command line is re-displayed; however, all of the editing state (cursor
position, selected text range, history recall position, and so on) is
duplicated from the previous editing session. So, although the user will
see that editing was interrupted, the user can continue editing the
command line exactly where they left off.

When this function is called without the *timeout* argument, or with nil
as the timeout value, it is similar to inputLine(), in that it allows
the user to edit a line of text, with no upper limit on how long to wait
until the user finishes. However, this function differs from inputLine()
in one important respect: if the preceding call to inputLineTimeout()
ended with the timeout expiring, and no intervening call to
inputLineCancel(true) was made since the timeout occurred, this function
will resume editing of the interrupted command line.

logConsoleClose(*handle*)

Closes the given console. This function closes the operating system
file, so no further text can be written to the console after this
function is called.

logConsoleCreate(*filename*, *charset*, *width*)

Creates a "log console." A log console is a special system object that
behaves much like the main game window, except that all of the text
written to a log console is captured in a text file rather than being
displayed.

*filename* is a string giving the name of the file to write, a
[FileName](filename.htm) object, or a [TemporaryFile](tempfile.htm)
object; any existing file with the same name will be overwritten.
*charset* can be a CharacterSet object, a string giving the name of a
character set, or nil to use the default log file character set. The
text in the log file will be written in the selected character set.
width is the maximum width, in text columns, for the text written to the
file; the console will automatically word-wrap the written text to this
width.

The return value is a "handle," which identifies the new console in
calls to other logConsoleXxx functions; if the return value is nil, the
system was unable to create the console.

If the given file cannot be created (because the name is invalid, for
example, or because there's no space on disk), a FileCreationException
is thrown. The "file safety" level must allow the operation, otherwise a
FileSafetyException is thrown.

Log consoles are in some ways similar to text files based on the File
intrinsic class. The difference is that text written to a File object is
written character-for-character exactly as you specify. In contrast, the
text written to a log console is processed the same way as text
displayed to the player: HTML markups are processed (although, in a log
console, only the text-only subset of HTML can be used, regardless of
the kind of interpreter being used), the text is word-wrapped (to the
fixed width given when the log console is created), excess whitespace is
removed, and so on.

Log consoles are also similar to the log files created with
setLogFile(). The only difference is that setLogFile() can only capture
text that is also displayed to the main game window; a log console has
no display component at all, so you can use a log console to capture
text exclusively to a file, without also showing it to the user.

Starting in 3.1.1, the [file safety](terp.htm#file-safety) settings must
allow write access to the target file. [FileName](filename.htm) objects
obtained from [inputFile()](tadsio.htm#inputFile) "save" dialogs are
always accessible.

logConsoleSay(*handle*, ...)

Writes the given arguments to the given log console. This behaves just
like tadsSay(), but writes the text to the given log console instead of
to the main game window. The handle is a log console handle previously
returned from logConsoleCreate().

You can also pass the special value MainWindowLogHandle for *handle*.
Doing this writes the text to the main game window's transcript file, if
any - this is the log file that's created by setLogFile(filename,
LogTypeTranscript). If you pass this special handle value when there
isn't an active transcript for the main game window, the function is
simply ignored; it's legal to call it in this case, but it will have no
effect. (You can't use logConsoleClose() to close this special handle;
to close the main game window's log file, you must call setLogFile(nil,
LogTypeTranscript).)

Note that you can also write text to the main game window's transcript -
without having the text show up in the main window itself - by writing
the text to the main window and enclosing the text in \<LOG\>...\</LOG\>
tags. These tags hide the text from the display window, but include it
in the transcript file. They're the complement of the
\<NOLOG\>...\</NOLOG\> tags, which you can use to show text in the game
window but exclude it from any transcript file. The \<LOG\>...\</LOG\>
sequence is often a better way than logConsoleSay() to add text to the
main transcript, since it lets you write the text through the library's
standard stack of output filters. Calling
logConsoleSay(MainWindowLogHandle, val) is best for situations where you
specifically want to bypass the normal output stream handling for the
main game window, and instead go directly to the file.

morePrompt()

Display the MORE prompt on the main console window, and wait for the
user to respond. This can be used when you want to pause execution and
wait for the user to acknowledge some output before proceeding.

resExists(*resname*)

Check to see if the given resource can be found. Returns true if the
resource is present, nil if not. For HTML TADS 3, this looks for an HTML
resource; text-only TADS 3 interpreters always return nil for this
function, since they don't use multi-media resources at all.

The resource name *resname* should be specified as a URL-style name
string. The interpreter will look for the resource using the same
searching rules that it uses for normal resource loading; the HTML
interpreter will thus look for the resource bundled into the image file,
in any external resource files (image.3r0 through image.3r9), and
finally in an external file whose name is derived from the URL according
to local system conventions.

setLogFile(*fname*, *logType*?)

Log console output to a file, or stop logging.

If *fname* is not nil, this starts logging to the specified file.
*fname* can be a string giving the name of the file for saving the log,
a [FileName](filename.htm) object, or a [TemporaryFile](tempfile.htm)
object. If *fname* refers to an existing file, the existing file will be
overwritten by the new log output.

If *fname* is nil, the function turns off the specified type of logging,
closing the current log file.

logType specifies the type of logging to perform:

- LogTypeTranscript - create a transcript. All of the text displayed to
  the main console (including text read via command line input) is
  copied to the file. Any HTML markups are processed before the text is
  written to the file; note, though, that the text-only HTML subset is
  used, regardless of what kind of interpreter is running. This is the
  default log type if the logType parameter is omitted.
- LogTypeCommand - create a command log. Only the input commands are
  copied to the log file. This creates a command-line script, suitable
  for later replay (such as with setScriptFile()).
- LogTypeEvent - create an event script. Command lines, keys, hyperlink
  clicks, dialog button clicks, and file dialog selections are captured
  to the script, which can later be replayed (with setScriptFile(), for
  example).

The return value is true if the operation succeeded, nil if the file
couldn't be opened. Opening a file can fail due to the usual file system
errors, such as an invalid filename, insufficient disk space, or file
permission errors. When closing a file (by passing nil for *fname*), the
function always returns true.

You can record a "transcript" and a "script" file simultaneously, but
only one of each type can be recorded at a time. If you start a new
transcript file (LogTypeTranscript), any previous transcript will be
closed. Similarly, if you start a new script file (LogTypeCommand or
LogTypeScript), any previous script file will be closed. Recordings
don't nest; starting a new recording simply stops any previous recording
of the same type.

Refer to [Input Scripts](scripts.htm) for more details on scripts,
including the differences between Command-line and Event scripts.

Starting in 3.1.1, the [file safety](terp.htm#file-safety) settings must
allow write access to the target file. [FileName](filename.htm) objects
obtained from [inputFile()](tadsio.htm#inputFile) "save" dialogs are
always accessible.

setScriptFile(*filename*, *flags*?)

Start reading commands from a script file, or cancel existing script
input.

If *filename* is not nil, this starts reading from the given file.
*filename* can be a string containing the name of a file in the local
file system, a [FileName](filename.htm) object, or a
[TemporaryFile](tempfile.htm) object.

If *filename* is nil, this cancels input from the current script, as
though the end of the file had been reached. If the current script file
is nested within another script, this returns to the enclosing script.

The optional *flags* value lets you specify how to read the script file.
The following values can be combined (with the bitwise OR operator
"\|"):

- ScriptFileQuiet - do not display any output while reading the script
  file. If this flag isn't set, the input lines read from the script
  file and the resulting output will be displayed as though the user had
  typed the lines of text at the keyboard.
- ScriptFileNonstop - turn off the MORE prompt while reading the script
  file; output will scroll by without any user intervention. If this
  flag isn't used, the MORE prompt will be displayed each time the
  screen fills up with text, and the user will have to acknowledge the
  prompt before more output will be displayed.

If the *flags* argument is omitted, a default value of 0 will be used,
so none of the flags will be set.

The function returns true on success, nil on error. An error return
means that the script file doesn't exist or couldn't be opened. The
function always returns true if *filename* is nil.

When the interpreter reaches the end of a script file, it automatically
closes the file and returns to normal keyboard input, so calling this
function with *filename* set to nil isn't necessary unless you want to
explicitly interrupt the script before reaching the end of the file.

Input scripts can be nested. If setScriptFile() is called with a non-nil
filename when a script file is already in effect, the interpreter will
remember the position in the old script file, then start reading from
the new script file; upon reaching the end of the new script file, or
upon an explicit setScriptFile(nil) call, the interpreter will resume
reading from the old script file. Scripts can be nested in this manner
to any depth. This allows one script file to "include" another, for
example.

See [Script Files](scripts.htm) for information on how input scripts are
interpreted.

**Status queries:** In version 3.0.17 and later, this function can also
query the current script playback status. To get the status, use
setScriptFile(ScriptReqGetStatus). If input is currently being read from
the keyboard, the return value is nil. If a script is being played back,
the return value is an integer giving a combination of ScriptFileXxx
flags describing the playback mode. Note that a return value of 0 (zero)
indicates that a script **is** being played back, but that none of the
mode flags apply.

In addition to the flags defined above, the flag ScriptFileEvent is
included in the status value if the current script is an event script
rather than a command-line script. Note that this flag is ignored if you
include it in the 'flags' argument when calling setScriptFile() to start
playback of a new script; the script reader automatically determines
whether the new script is an event script or a command-line script by
examining the file's contents. The purpose of this additional flag is to
let you find out what the script reader decided about the current
script.

If you call the function in this form on VM versions prior to 3.0.17,
the function will throw a RuntimeError, because earlier implementations
only accepted a string or nil for the first argument. You can use
try-catch to handle this situation: if the function throws a
RuntimeError (with errno\_ == 2019), it means that you're running on a
version of the VM that doesn't support the function.

Starting in 3.1.1, the [file safety](terp.htm#file-safety) settings must
allow read access to the target file. [FileName](filename.htm) objects
obtained from [inputFile()](tadsio.htm#inputFile) "open" dialogs are
always accessible.

statusMode(*mode*)

Set the "status line mode." This can be used to control the status line
in non-HTML mode and for older text-only interpreters that don't support
the Banner API. The *mode* setting controls where text is displayed;
this can be one of the following:

- StatModeNormal - text is displayed in the main text area
- StatModeStatus - text is displayed to the left portion of the status
  line

To write to the status line in non-HTML mode and on text-only
interpreters, set the status mode to StatModeStatus, write the status
line text as though it were ordinary display output, and finally set the
status mode back to StatModeNormal:

    statusMode(StatModeStatus);
    "Loud Room";
    statusMode(StatModeNormal);

statusRight(*txt*)

Write the text string *txt* to the right half of the status line. This
can be used to control the right portion of the status line on older
text-only interpreters that don't support the Banner API.

systemInfo(*infoType*, ...)

Retrieve information about the TADS 3 application environment. This
retrieves information on the interpreter and operating system that's
running the program.

*infoType* is one of the SysInfoXxx constants listed below; it specifies
the type of information being requested. Additional parameters vary
according to the *infoType* value; unless otherwise specified, no
additional parameters are used. The return value contains the
information requested; the type and meaning vary according to the
*infoType* code.

This API is designed to allow for future SysTypeXxx codes to be added in
future versions, as follows. In particular, it's legal to pass an
arbitrary integer value for *infoType*; if the interpreter doesn't
recognize the selector value, it will always return nil as the result of
the function. This allows a newer game to use a recently added selector
code, and still get meaningful results from an older interpreter that
was released before that selector code was added. Therefore, nil is a
special return value for this function: it always means either that the
selector isn't recognized, or that the selector is recognized but the
feature it asks about isn't present; in either case, it tells the caller
that the feature being queried can't be used.

The *infoType* codes are:

- SysInfoInterpClass - get the interpreter "class," which indicates the
  broad capabilities of the interpreter. The following classes are
  defined:
  - SysInfoIClassText - character-mode text-only interpreter, such as
    Unix TADS or MS-DOS TADS. These interpreters use a single,
    fixed-pitch font, cannot display any graphics, and support only the
    text-only HTML subset.

  - SysInfoIClassTextGUI - GUI text-only interpreter, such as WinTADS or
    MacTADS. These interpreters behave essentially the same as
    character-mode interpreters, but run on graphical operating systems
    and thus might use proportional fonts, boldface text, and so on.
    These interpreters can't display graphics explicitly, but might use
    some graphics automatically (for drawing window borders, for
    example). These support only the text-only HTML subset.

  - SysInfoIClassHTML - a full HTML interpreter running on a graphical
    platform, such as HTML TADS for Windows, CocoaTADS for Mac OS X, or
    QTads for Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. These interpreters can use
    multiple fonts of varying sizes, including proportional fonts, can
    display graphics and play sounds, and recognize the full HTML TADS
    markup language.

    Note that the advent of the Web UI in TADS 3.1 clouds the picture a
    little bit. With the Web UI, the game's user interface runs in a
    browser that's separate from the interpreter, and the *browser*
    always uses HTML even if the interpreter doesn't. The interpreter
    class indicates the capabilities of the *built-in user interface* in
    the interpreter, which Web UI games generally don't use at all. If
    you're writing for the Web UI, the actual user interface is always a
    browser, and is therefore always HTML capable, regardless of the
    interpreter class. Note that you don't need to worry about whether
    or not the interpreter supports the Web UI, because this is handled
    at load time: a game that uses the Web UI simply won't load on an
    interpreter that doesn't support the Web UI, since that interpreter
    won't have the necessary intrinsic classes and functions that the
    game requires.
- SysInfoVersion - get the interpreter version information. The return
  value is a string of the form '3.0.10' giving the major, minor, and
  point-release numbers.
- SysInfoOsName - get the OS name. This returns a string giving a short
  name for the operating system 'MSDOS', 'WIN32', 'Mac OS', etc.
- SysInfoJpeg - can the renderer display JPEG images? Returns 1 if so, 0
  if not.
- SysInfoPng - can the renderer display PNG images? Returns 1 if so, 0
  if not.
- SysInfoWav - can the system play WAVE sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if
  not.
- SysInfoMidi - can the system play MIDI sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if
  not.
- SysInfoWavMidiOvl - can the system play WAVE and MIDI sounds
  simultaneously? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoWavOvl - can the system play multiple WAVE sounds
  simultaneously? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPrefImages - do the user's preferences allow images to be
  displayed? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPrefSounds - do the user's preferences allow sound effects to
  be played? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPrefMusic - do the user's preferences allow music to be played?
  Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPrefLinks - do the user's preferences allow hyperlinks to be
  displayed distinctively (i.e., not as ordinary text, but using a
  special style to indicate that they're links)? Returns 1 if so, 0 if
  not.
- SysInfoMpeg - can the system play MPEG sounds of any kind? Returns 1
  if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoMpeg1 - can the system play MPEG layer 1 (MP1) sounds? Returns
  1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoMpeg2 - can the system play MPEG layer 2 (MP2) sounds? Returns
  1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoMpeg3 - can the system play MPEG layer 3 (MP3) sounds? Returns
  1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoLinksHttp - can the system follow hyperlinks that use the
  "http:" scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoLinksFtp - can the system follow hyperlinks that use the "ftp:"
  scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoLinksNews - can the system follow hyperlinks that use the
  "news:" scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoLinksMailto - can the system follow hyperlinks that use the
  "mailto:" scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoLinksTelnet - can the system follow hyperlinks that use the
  "telnet:" scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPngTrans - can the system properly display transparent PNG's
  overlayed on their backgrounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoPngAlpha - can the system use alpha-channel (partial
  transparency) blending in PNG's? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoOgg - can the system play Ogg Vorbis sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0
  if not.
- SysInfoMng - can the system display MNG images? Returns 1 if so, 0 if
  not.
- SysInfoMngTrans - can the system properly display transparent MNG's
  overlayed on their backgrounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoMngAlpha - can the system use alpha-channel (partial
  transparency) blending in MNG's? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoTextHilite - can the system render highlighted text (text in
  \<B\>...\</B\> tags) distinctively? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.
- SysInfoTextColors - does the system provide control text colors (via
  \<FONT COLOR=xxx\> tags)? Returns one of the following codes
  indicating the level of support provided:
  - nil - the SysInfoTextColors code is not recognized by the system
  - SysInfoTxcNone - no text color control is provided; \<FONT COLOR\>
    is ignored
  - SysInfoTxcParam - some or all of the parameterized color names
    (BGCOLOR, TEXT, STATUSBG, STATUSTEXT, etc.) can be used with \<FONT
    COLOR=xxx\>, but specific colors will be ignored
  - SysInfoTxcAnsiFg - the ANSI colors (black, white, red, green, blue,
    yellow, cyan, magenta) can be used as foreground colors, but
    background colors cannot be set
  - SysInfoTxcAnsiFgBg - the ANSI colors can be used as foreground and
    background colors.
  - SysInfoTxcRGB - any RGB color can be used for foreground and
    background colors. (This is the code normally returned by the HTML
    interpreters. This doesn't necessarily indicate that the user is
    running in a 24-bit graphic mode; it simply indicates that the

- SysInfoBanners - does the system support the banner window API?
- SysInfoAudioFade - does the system support audio fades? This returns
  nil or 0 if fades aren't supported at all; otherwise it returns an
  integer giving a bitwise combination of the codes SysInfoFadeMPEG,
  SysInfoFadeOGG, SysInfoFadeWAV, and SysInfoFadeMIDI indicating which
  formats can be used with audio fades. (Audio fading is an HTML TADS
  feature, accessed through the \<SOUND\> tag.
- SysInfoAudioCrossfade - does the system support audio cross-fades?
  This returns nil or 0 if cross-fades aren't supported at all;
  otherwise it returns an integer giving a bitwise combination of codes
  indicating which formats allow cross-fades. The codes have the same
  meanings as the codes returns for SysInfoAudioFade.

tadsSay(*val*, ...)

Display one or more values. Each value is displayed on the console,
starting with the first argument; the displayed values are not separated
by any spaces or other delimiters. The formatting for each value depends
upon its type:

- string: the text of the string is displayed
- integer: the decimal representation of the number is displayed
- BigNumber: the number is displayed with the default formatting
- list or Vector: the elements of the list or Vector are displayed in
  order, separated by commas
- nil: nothing is displayed
- objects with implicit string conversions (e.g., a
  [ByteArray](bytearr.htm) or [Date](date.htm) object) are converted to
  strings using their default string formatting, and the the results are
  displayed; see the [toString()](tadsgen.htm#toString) function
- any other type is invalid; a run-time error is generated ("invalid
  type for built-in function")

The function has no return value.

timeDelay(*delay*)

Pause execution for the given number of milliseconds. The precision of
system timers varies, so the actual delay might differ somewhat from the
exact time specified on some systems according to the available hardware
timer precision.

## Real-time input

A real-time event is an event that occurs at a particular point in
"wall-clock" time; for example, an event programmed to occur at 9:00 PM
is a real-time event, because it's scheduled according to time in the
real world. It's more typical to schedule a real-time event to occur
after some number of seconds or minutes has elapsed than to schedule one
for a particular time on the clock on the wall, but elapsed-time events
are also real-time events, because they depend on the passage of time on
the clock.

In most programs that take their input from a command line (say, text
adventure games), reading a command line from the user stops everything
until the user finishes entering the command by pressing Enter. This is
known as a "blocking" operation, because the operation blocks the
program's progress until the command line is finished: the program
simply waits as long as it takes for the user to type the command line
and press the Enter key. For this reason, command-line programs don't
usually incorporate real-time events, and most programs with real-time
events don't use command lines.

TADS 3 has the ability to mix command-line input and real-time events,
thanks to the inputLineTimeout() function. This section describes how to
use this feature.

Note that the information below applies to the low-level system API. If
you're using the adv3 library, you won't have to worry about any of
these details, because adv3's input and output managers work together
with its real-time event manager to handle all of this for you
automatically. With adv3, you simply create real-time event objects
describing the event timeline, and the library's input manager handles
everything else.

The inputLineTimeout() function works a lot like the ordinary
inputLine() function, which reads a line of text from the keyboard and
returns a string containing the text, but inputLineTimeout() has the
additional feature of letting you specify a time limit, called a
"timeout." A timeout is simply a maximum real-time interval; when the
interval expires, inputLineTimeout() returns, even if the user hasn't
finished editing the command line. The function returns information that
lets you tell whether or not the user finished editing the command
before the timeout expired. (If the user finished entering the command
and presses Enter *before* the timeout expires, the function returns
immediately - the timeout is the *longest* the function will wait to
return, but it can return sooner if the user types fast enough.)

At the simplest level, you could imagine a game that imposes a time
limit for typing certain commands. For example, a sadistic game designer
might want to design a traditional adventure game maze, with the novel
twist that the player has to move out of each room within ten seconds of
real time or face some penalty, such as being moved back to the start of
the maze. To do this, you could use inputLineTimeout() with a timeout
value of 10000 (ten thousand milliseconds equals ten seconds), imposing
the penalty if the function ever returns with a timeout.

This type of use of inputLineTimeout() wouldn't win many admirers, but
fortunately it's not at all the scenario for which this function was
designed. In fact, the key feature of the function is that it not only
allows you to interrupt a command line, but also allows you to *resume*
an interrupted command line. This is crucial: because you can resume an
interrupted command line, you can write your program so that it
continues to process events in real time, even while the user is editing
a command; the user's editing and your real-time events can proceed in
parallel, with neither blocking the other.

There are three possible ways to use inputLineTimeout().

**Scenario 1: Limited-time input.** This is the real-time-maze scenario
described above, where the program solicits command-line input from the
user, but only allows the user a limited amount of time to complete the
input. In this scenario, when the time limit expires, the user's chance
to enter a command has ended: the program does not allow the user to
resume editing the command later.

This is the simplest scenario, because the program unconditionally
cancels the input when it times out. To do this, you simply call the
function inputLineCancel() when a timeout occurs. Here's how this looks:

    /* read a command, with a 10-second time limit */
    local result = inputLineTimeout(10000);
    if (result[1] == InEvtTimeout)
    {
      /* timed out - cancel input and forget the buffer */
      inputLineCancel(true);

      /*
       *  gloat about defeating the user with our clever time
       *  limit ruse, using the spelling enjoyed by usenet
       *  posters everywhere
       */
      "Ha, ha!  You LOOSE!";
      // etc
    }
    else
    {
      /* darn, they were fast enough */
      // move to the new location, etc
    }

**Scenario 2: Internal computation only, with resumed editing.**
Sometimes you'll want to perform some operation at a particular time,
but the operation won't perform any display operations. For example,
suppose you're writing a detective game, and you have one character in
the game who moves around according to a real-time schedule. When you're
about to read an input line, you can check the character's schedule,
calculate the delay until the character's next move, and then use that
delay as the timeout value for inputLineTimeout().

If inputLineTimeout() returns a timeout event, you'd move your character
according to the schedule. Now, suppose the character isn't in sight of
the player character at any point during the scheduled travel. In this
case, you wouldn't want to display anything about the character's
travel: everything happens behind the scenes. So, you need to perform
the event in real time, so that the character moves to its new location
on schedule, but as far as the player is concerned, nothing happened.

In this case, you'd simply call inputLineTimeout() again after moving
the character. The function would pick up where it left off, with
absolutely no effects visible to the player. Nothing on the display
changes in this case, so the player simply thinks they've been editing
the same command all along.

The code for this is easy, as long as we can take for granted that we
know when the character's next move occurs.

    /* show the initial prompt */
    ">";

    /* keep looping forever */
    for (;;)
    {
      local delay;
      local result;

      /* calculate the interval until the next travel */
      delay = actor.nextMoveTime - getTime(GetTimeTicks);

      /* ask for input, waiting no longer than the timeout */
      evt = inputLineTimeout(delay);

      /* if we timed out, move the character */
      if (result[1] == InEvtTimeout)
      {
        /* time to go */
        actor.performNextTravel();
      }
      else
      {
        /* they entered a command - handle it */
        processCommand(result[2]);

        /* show the prompt again */
        ">";

      }
    }

Note that it's legal to update banner windows during interrupted input.
You could use code just like the example above, substituting banner
window displays for the performNextTravel() call. For example, you could
keep a running real-time clock in a banner window, updating it at each
input timeout. As long as you're not updating the main window, where the
input editing session is taking place, it's not necessary to cancel
input editing (as described in the next scenario).

**Scenario 3: Interruption with a displayed message, then resumed
editing.** This is the most complex situation, but in many ways the most
interesting. In this scenario, we want to tell the user about something
that happened during the real-time event, but we still want to let the
user go back to editing the command line after we finish processing the
event.

Our detective example above fits this scenario when the traveling actor
is in sight of the player character, because in this case we want to
tell the user that the traveling actor has departed or arrived. Once
we've described the departure or arrival, though, we want to let the
user continue editing the command, because the interruption doesn't
necessarily change what they would have typed, and (unlike Scenario 1)
doesn't take away the user's chance to type a command.

In this situation, we have to use the inputLineCancel() function,
passing nil as the *reset* argument. This function tells the system that
we are **not** processing Scenario 2; in particular, it tells the system
that it won't be able to pretend that the interruption never happened.
The reason we have to differentiate this case from Scenario 2 is that
when inputLineTimeout() returns with a timeout, the system
optimistically keeps everything on the screen and in memory in a state
where it could resume editing the same command later. This means that
any display operations - even something as simple as displaying a string
of text - would leave things terribly confused, because the system is
holding everything ready for more command line editing. To tell the
system that we wish to give up our right to resume editing with complete
transparency, and in exchange receive the right to perform other display
operations, we use inputLineCancel(nil).

Note that we use nil for reset argument to inputLineCancel() in this
scenario. This is because we wish to resume editing the command line
later. This might seem confusing - if we want to resume editing the
command later, why are we canceling in the first place? The solution to
this seeming contradiction is that canceling and resetting are not the
same thing. Canceling, which is what inputLineCancel() does regardless
of the *reset* argument, simply tells the system to give up hope for
transparently resuming editing. Resetting, which only occurs when the
*reset* argument to inputLineCancel() is true, tells the system to throw
away all information about editing. So, when you cancel without
resetting, you tell the system that you won't transparently resume
editing, but that you still wish to resume editing later, albeit not
transparently.

Here's what this looks like to the user. First, here's the way the
screen looks when the user is first presented with the command line:

    What do you, the detective, want to do next?
    >|

(That vertical bar, \|, is meant to represent the cursor, where text the
user types is inserted.) Now, the user starts typing a command, and the
screen looks like this after a bit:

    What do you, the detective, want to do next?
    >look at the v|

Now, at this point, our timeout expires, and we discover that it's time
to move Miss Marmalade into the same room where the player character is
located. We call inputLineCancel(nil) to tell the system that we wish to
perform some output operations in lieu of resuming editing
transparently, then we add our displayed messages. Finally, we call
inputLineTimeout() again to resume editing. Here's what the user sees:

    What do you, the detective, want to do next?
    >look at the v

    Miss Marmalade enters from the north.  She pretends
    not to see you, busying herself with rummaging for
    something in her purse.

    >look at the v|

Notice that the partially-constructed command line now appears twice on
the screen - once before the interruption, and again after. The first
copy is no longer the active command line; it's left on screen only to
maintain continuity, so that the user isn't startled by the text
suddenly disappearing. After this, we see the text displayed during the
real-time interruption, and finally we see the new command line, where
we've reinstated the text the user has entered so far, as well as the
original cursor position.

This is what we mean by "non-transparent" resumption of editing. The
resumption isn't transparent, in that the user can plainly see on the
screen that the editing was interrupted. We are nonetheless resuming the
editing session fairly seamlessly. If the user had their eyes closed,
they could keep editing the command without knowing that we interrupted
them, because the text on the line, the cursor position, and all other
editing state is the same as it was before the interruption; the only
thing that has changed is that more text is on the screen than when we
started.

The code for this case is almost exactly the same as the example code in
Scenario 2, with two changes. First, we must call inputLineCancel(nil)
before we display the message about Miss Marmalde moving; we'd put this
call just before the call to actor.performNextTravel(). Second, we'd
have to re-display the \> prompt before we resume editing the command;
we could do this before the call to inputLineTimeout().
