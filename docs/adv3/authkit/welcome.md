# Welcome to the TADS 3 Author\'s Kit

Thanks for installing the TADS 3 Author\'s Kit! This kit has everything
you need to create your own Interactive Fiction games using TADS 3.

## TADS Player Kit

Now that you\'ve installed the Author\'s Kit, you might also want to
install the TADS Player Kit. The Player Kit is a combined version of the
Interpreter that can play games for both TADS 2 and TADS 3, and also
features the Game Chest for organizing your favorite games. You can find
the Player Kit download on [tads.org](http://www.tads.org).

## Problems?

If you run into any problems with TADS, please check the [System
Compatibility Notes](../compat.htm). There are a few known problems with
certain Windows configurations, and the notes explain how to fix these.
You should read the compatibility notes in particular if:

-   HTML TADS is crashing;
-   you\'re using a Linux system running Wine;
-   you\'re using a non-English version of Windows.

## [Documentation]{#getting_started}

The TADS 3 documentation is organized into several manuals, which you
can find them on the [User\'s Manuals](../../doc/index.htm) page.

If you\'re new to TADS, there are two introductory books by Eric Eve to
choose from. *Getting Started in TADS 3* is a tutorial designed for
beginners, especially those without prior programming experience.
*Learning TADS 3* is written for confident newcomers and those with a
little programming experience. They\'re both available on the [User\'s
Manuals](../../doc/index.htm) page.

You can find help with programming and game design questions on a number
of Interactive Fiction community forums. For links to IF community
resources, see [tads.org](http://www.tads.org).
