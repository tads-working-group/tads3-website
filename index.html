        <h1>Empowering Ambitious Authors</h1>
        <p>TADS 3 is a <em>powerful and flexible interactive fiction
            authoring system</em> designed and built for <em>ambitious authors</em>.
            It brings to the table a <em>powerful and dynamic</em> yet <em>fun to use</em> object-oriented
        language purpose built for writing interactive fiction, two advanced
        standard libraries that push the boundaries of what interactive fiction
            is capable of both in <em>simulation</em> and in <em>customizability</em>, as well as
            <em>unparalleled multimedia capabilities</em>.<br/><br/> </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Want to write a story with incredible simulational
                    sophistication, dynamic runtime capabilities, advanced
                    programming constructs, wild new game mechanics, or
                    something else? TADS is capable of entire categories of
                    feats impossible for other interactive fiction authoring
                    systems. Authors switching to TADS will find
                    new fields of imagination opened to them!</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Interested in simulation? Both of TADS 3's standard
                    libraries come with rich and fully-featured world models
                    with all of the features you could possibly need for even
                    the most complex and simulation-heavy parser game. Nevertheless, if you don't need these
                    features, they fade into the background cleanly.</p>

                    <p>Want to use new senses, or navigate in non-Euclidian
                        directions? Although TADS 3's standard libraries come with
                        highly complex world models already, those assumptions are
                        just your starting point! TADS 3 is designed to make your
                        own code, the standard library code, and even the langauge
                        itself, flexible and extensible in a way that makes games
                        fun to write and easy to iterate on.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Already comfortable with programming? TADS 3 is designed
                    with advanced interactive fiction authors in mind, offering
                    the clarity, conciseness, and specificity of a fully-fledged
                    programming language with all the capabilities you would
                    expect and much more. TADS is confident in its authors'
                    ability to use complex, powerful, and advanced feature sets,
                    which enables it to do a lot more without worrying about
                    whether its users can keep up.</p>

            <h2>Ready to <em>learn more</em>?</h2>

            <p>TADS 3 is comprised of several core components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A special-purpose object-oriented <em>programming language</em> designed
                with concise yet readable syntax and a focus on <em>extensibility</em>, <em>dynamic typing</em>, and <em>ease of defining new objects</em> (and
                sub-objects including contained and component objects) with
                custom properties and methods without having to declare a new
                class. The TADS 3 language makes growing and modifying your game &mdash; and the standard library! &mdash; fast,
                fun, and easy.</li>

                <li>A <em>text-adventure-specific standard library</em> (two, in
                    fact) containing an <em>advanced world model</em> that includes things
                    like <em>room parts</em>, <em>sense-passing</em>, a complex understanding of
                <em>attachable and detachable sub components and object
                    relationships</em>, and <em>hundreds of different powerful properties</em> to customize the precise
                behavior of each object, an advanced and extremely customizable
                parser that can understand arbitrary custom sentences, and
                perform user-customizable spell check &mdash; and more.</li>

                <li>A performant <em>compiler</em> to compile those programs,</li>

                <li>and an advanced <em>virtual machine</em> to run TADS programs and produce output.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In addition, there are also different kinds of <em>interpreters</em> that
            use the virtual machine to run your TADS games and then interpret
            the output produced by the games into the multimedia output and
            graphical user interface players see.</p>

            <p>To learn more about, and download, these components, see <a href="#install">below</a></p>

            <p>TADS 3 also has an <i>extensive</i> set of learning resources,

            all of which are many hundreds of detailed, orderly, and clear pages
            long. If you've struggled with the documentation of other
            interactive fiction authoring systems in the past, or are concerned
            that using such a niche piece of software will make answers hard to
            find, fear not! Michael J. Roberts and Eric Eve have ensured that no
            TADS programmer will ever stay confused for long. For more
            information on which manuals to read and where to find a full list
            of TADS documentation for each of the respective standard libraries,

                                released in September of 1990 as shareware under the imprint of "High Energy
                                Software", a company created by Roberts and his friend Steve McAdams, at a time
                                when the only other option for writing interactive fiction was <a href="https://www.ifwiki.org/AGT">AGT</a>. It was fairly popular at the time, spawning a trilogy of shareware Zork homage/parodies that were "the most concerted and sustained effort at building a real business out of [the shareware IF scene]" at
                                the time.<sup><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/02/tads/">1</a></sup></p>

                            <p>By the time of TADS 2.2.1, released in October of 1996, due to a
                                lack of money in the shareware business, TADS was released as
                                freeware: although not stricty free software, since forks and modifications for
                                the purpose of anything but porting were verboten, free
                                use, copying, and distribution were now allowed.</p>

                                a brand new revitalization superceding TADS 2. Despite being

                                interactive fiction authoring system capabilities and world models
                                in many ways, including with runtime object cloning and creation,
                                multi-channel audio capabilities, and sense-passing for any kind of
                                sense, even user-defined ones. The core appeal of TADS goes beyond
                                specific features, however.</p>
